Description: The package contains a suite of tools to support authors in making their research more discoverable. 
    check_keywords() - this function checks the keywords to assess whether they are already represented in the 
    titles and abstracts. check_fields() - this function compares terminology used across the title, abstract 
    and keywords to assess where terminological diversity (i.e. the use of synonyms) could increase the likelihood 
    of the record being identified in a search. The function looks for terms in the title and abstract that also 
    exist in other fields and highlights these as needing attention. suggest_keywords() - this function takes a 
    full text document and produces a list of unigrams, bigrams and trigrams (one-, two- or three-word phrases) 
    present in the full text after removing stop words that do not occur in the title or abstract that may be 
    suitable candidates for keywords. suggest_title() - this function takes a full text document and produces 
    a list of the most frequently used unigrams, bigrams and trigrams (one-, two- or three-word phrases) after 
    removing stop words that do not occur in the abstract or keywords that may be suitable candidates for title 
    words. check_title() - this function carries out a number of subtasks:  2) It compares the length (number of 
    words) of the title with the mean length of titles in major bibliographic databases to assess whether the title 
    is likely to be too short; 2) It assesses the proportion of stop words in the title to highlight titles with 
    low utility in search engines that strip out stop words; 3)It compares the title with a given sample of record 
    titles from an .ris import and calculates a similarity score based on phrase overlap. This highlights the level 
    of uniqueness of the title.
