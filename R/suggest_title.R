#' Remove stop words from text
#'
#' Removes stop words from a text string (adapted from 'litsearchr') and returns the remaining words as 
#' a vector of strings
#' @param text An input string
#' @param language The language used to look up stop words (default is "English")
#' @return A vector of strings consisting of the non-stop words from the 'text' input
#' @examples 
#' text <- "A methodology for systematic mapping in environmental sciences"
#' tokens <- get_tokens(text)
#' tokens;
#' @importFrom magrittr "%>%"
#' @export
get_tokens <- function(text, language = "English"){
  
  # convert input text to lower case
  text <- tolower(text)
  
  # look up list of stop words based on the specified language and remove them from the text
  text <- tm::scan_tokenizer(tm::removeWords(text, tm::stopwords(language)))
  
  # return the text without the stop words
  return(text)
}

#' Suggest title words
#'
#' Suggests possible title words by extracting 'uni-', 'bi-', and 'tri-grams' from a long text (e.g. 
#' article full text), having removed punctuation and stop words. Returns the remaining words as a 
#' vector of strings and assesses whether they are already present in the title or abstract
#' @param abstract An article abstract
#' @param fulltext An article full text
#' @param keywords An article keywords, supplied as a vector
#' @param suggest A logical argument of TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE, the output data frame returned is 
#' sub-setting to only include potential keywords (i.e. those not already in the abstract or keywords)
#' @return A data frame consisting of potential candidate title words and their suitability. If suggest 
#' = FALSE, only good candidates are returned.

#' abstract <- "Systematic mapping was developed in social sciences in response to a lack of empirical 
#'   data when answering questions using systematic review methods, and a need for a method to describe 
#'   the literature across a broad subject of interest. Systematic mapping does not attempt to answer 
#'   a specific question as do systematic reviews, but instead collates, describes and catalogues 
#'   available evidence (e.g. primary, secondary, theoretical, economic) relating to a topic or 
#'   question of interest. The included studies can be used to identify evidence for policy-relevant 
#'   questions, knowledge gaps (to help direct future primary research) and knowledge clusters (sub-
#'   sets of evidence that may be suitable for secondary research, for example systematic review). 
#'   Evidence synthesis in environmental sciences faces similar challenges to those found in social 
#'   sciences. Here we describe the translation of systematic mapping methodology from social sciences 
#'   for use in environmental sciences. We provide the first process-based methodology for systematic 
#'   maps, describing the stages involved: establishing the review team and engaging stakeholders; 
#'   setting the scope and question; setting inclusion criteria for studies; scoping stage; protocol 
#'   development and publication; searching for evidence; screening evidence; coding; production of a 
#'   systematic map database; critical appraisal (optional); describing and visualising the findings; 
#'   report production and supporting information. We discuss the similarities and differences in 
#'   methodology between systematic review and systematic mapping and provide guidance for those 
#'   choosing which type of synthesis is most suitable for their requirements. Furthermore, we discuss 
#'   the merits and uses of systematic mapping and make recommendations for improving this evolving 
#'   methodology in environmental sciences."
