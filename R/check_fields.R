#' title <- "A methodology for systematic mapping in environmental sciences"
#' abstract <- "Systematic mapping was developed in social sciences in response to a lack of empirical 
#'   data when answering questions using systematic review methods, and a need for a method to describe 
#'   the literature across a broad subject of interest. Systematic mapping does not attempt to answer 
#'   a specific question as do systematic reviews, but instead collates, describes and catalogues 
#'   available evidence (e.g. primary, secondary, theoretical, economic) relating to a topic or 
#'   question of interest. The included studies can be used to identify evidence for policy-relevant 
#'   questions, knowledge gaps (to help direct future primary research) and knowledge clusters (sub-
#'   sets of evidence that may be suitable for secondary research, for example systematic review). 
#'   Evidence synthesis in environmental sciences faces similar challenges to those found in social 
#'   sciences. Here we describe the translation of systematic mapping methodology from social sciences 
#'   for use in environmental sciences. We provide the first process-based methodology for systematic 
#'   maps, describing the stages involved: establishing the review team and engaging stakeholders; 
#'   setting the scope and question; setting inclusion criteria for studies; scoping stage; protocol 
#'   development and publication; searching for evidence; screening evidence; coding; production of a 
#'   systematic map database; critical appraisal (optional); describing and visualising the findings; 
#'   report production and supporting information. We discuss the similarities and differences in 
#'   methodology between systematic review and systematic mapping and provide guidance for those 
#'   choosing which type of synthesis is most suitable for their requirements. Furthermore, we discuss 
#'   the merits and uses of systematic mapping and make recommendations for improving this evolving 
#'   methodology in environmental sciences."
