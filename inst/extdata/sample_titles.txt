AB  - The urbanization of agricultural lands is currently one of the dominant patterns of land use change in developed countries. In the United States and parts of Europe, this has led to the implementation of agricultural land preservation programs and riparian protection and replanting efforts along urban streams. The ecological benefits of such programs for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity have yet to be fully explored. We designed a study to investigate the patterns of stream macroinvertebrate community structure along a gradient of agriculture to urban development, and the patterns among urban streams that vary in the amount of intact riparian buffer. In 2001 and 2002, we sampled the 29 small headwater streams comprising the outlying tributaries of four watersheds just north of Washington, D.C., in Montgomery County, Maryland, USA. This region has had dramatic urban development over the last 50 years, yet significant efforts have been made to maintain riparian buffers and promote preservation of agricultural land. Macroinvertebrate richness was strongly related to land use, with agricultural streams exhibiting the highest macroinvertebrate diversity. Taxa richness was related negatively and linearly (no statistical threshold) to the amount of impervious surface cover. For the urban streams, there was a strong positive relationship between invertebrate diversity and riparian forest cover. Urban streams with high amounts of intact riparian forest exhibited biodiversity levels more comparable to less urban areas despite high amounts of impervious cover in their catchments. The agricultural headwater streams in this study were not only more diverse than the urban headwaters, but their levels of macroinvertebrate diversity were high compared to other published estimates for agricultural streams. These higher richness values may be due to widespread use of "best management practices" (BMPs), including no-till farming and the implementation of woody and herbaceous riparian buffers, which may alleviate many acute stressors caused by cultivation. These findings suggest that, if managed properly, the preservation of agricultural land from development may help conserve stream invertebrate biodiversity, and that maintenance of riparian forests even in highly urbanized watersheds may help alleviate ecological disturbances that might otherwise limit macroinvertebrate survival.

AB  -. Question: How distinct is the flora of field boundaries? How does the structure of field boundaries determine the composition of vegetation? Location: Estonia, six 4 km × 4 km agricultural areas. Methods: We studied the vegetation of fields and field boundaries using 2 m × 2 m sample plots. We estimated the frequency of species in both habitat types, applied an MRPP test to analyse the vegetation composition of field boundaries with various combinations of landscape features (ditches, roads, tree and bush layers) illustrating this by DCA ordination, and used indicator species analysis to determine the characteristic species of each boundary type. Results: Ca. 45% of the flora of field boundaries comprised species found on agricultural land. Most typical species in fields - agrotolerants - were also the most common in field boundaries. The vegetation of road verges and grassy boundaries consisted mainly of disturbance-tolerant species. Woody boundaries were characterised by shade-tolerant and nitrophilous species. Ditch banks included species typical of moist habitats and semi-natural grasslands. Few threatened or protected species were observed. Conclusion: The vegetation composition of field boundaries varied due to the complex effects of landscape structure around and in these boundaries. Plant species in agricultural landscapes can be classified into two broad emergent groups on the basis of their different responses to agricultural disturbances - agrotolerant species and nature-value species. Agrotolerant species are promoted by agriculture, nature-value species include rare weeds and habitat specialists. We suggest that high-nature-value species should prevail in monitoring the effects of land-use intensification on biodiversity rather than total species richness.

AB  - The general aim of the study was to determine the main factors of plant species richness and composition in field boundaries. We surveyed the vegetation of field boundaries in organic and non-organic farms, recorded the field boundary type and width. We characterized landscape structure around the vegetation plots (r=250m). We classified plant species into two ecological response groups: (1) common weeds and other species occurring frequently on agricultural land, i.e. 'agrotolerant species'(47 species), and (2) all other species intolerant to contemporary agricultural practices-so-called 'nature-value species' (190 species). We analysed the effect of organic farming, boundary type and landscape structure on the diversity of these two species groups. We found that field boundary type and landscape structure described most of the variation in species composition of these boundaries, while organic farming had little effect. However, the analysis of plant species diversity revealed that organic farming significantly supported the species richness of high nature-vaiue species by increasing species richness on average by two species on 4 m(2) plot, while the richness of agrotolerant species did not depend on farming type. Boundary type had a specific impact on species diversity-ditches enhanced the richness of nature-value species and suppressed agrotolerants; woody boundaries hosted only a few agrotolerant species and road verges increased the species richness of both species groups. The richness of nature-value species benefited from wider open boundaries, while narrow boundaries hosted more agrotolerant species. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The impact of vegetated filter strips (VFS) on sediment removal from runoff has been studied extensively in recent years. Vegetation is believed to increase water infiltration and decrease water turbulence thus enhancing sediment deposition within filter media. In the study reported here, field experiments have been conducted to examine the efficiency of vegetated filter strips for sediment removal from cropland runoff. Twenty filters with varying length, slope and vegetated cover were used under simulated runoff conditions with an average sediment concentration of 2700 mg/L. The filters were 2, 5, 10 and 15 m long with a slope of 2.3 and 5% and three types of vegetation. Three other strips with bare soil were used as a control. The experimental results showed that the average sediment trapping efficiency of all filters was 84% and ranging from 68% in a 2-m filter to as high as 98% in a 15-m long filter compared with only 25% for the control. The length of filter has been found to be the predominant factor affecting sediment deposition in VFS up to 10 m. Increasing filter length to 15 m did not improve sediment trapping efficiency under the present experimental conditions. The rate of incoming flow and vegetation cover percentage has a secondary effect on sediment deposition in VFS. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Vegetated filter strips (VFS) are used recently for removal, at or near the source, of sediment and sediment-bound chemicals from cropland runoff. Vegetation within the flowpath increases water infiltration and decreases water turbulence, thus enhancing pollutant removal by sedimentation within filter media and infiltration through the filter surface. Field experiments have been conducted to examine the efficiency of vegetated filter strips for phosphorus removal from cropland runoff with 20 filters with varying length (2 to 15 m), slope (2.3 and 5%), and vegetated cover, including bare-soil plots as control. Artificial runoff used in this study had an average phosphorus concentration of 2.37 mg L-1 and a sediment concentration of 2700 mg L-1. The average phosphorus trapping efficiency of all vegetated filters was 61% and ranged from 31% in a 2-m filter to 89% in a 15-m filter. Filter length has been found to be the predominant factor affecting P trapping in VFS. The rate of inflow, type of vegetation, and density of vegetation coverage had secondary influences on P removal. Short filters (2 and 5 m), which are somewhat effective in sediment removal, are much less effective in P removal. Increasing the filter length beyond 15 m is ineffective in enhancing sediment removal but is expected to further enhance P removal. Sediment deposition, infiltration, and plant adsorption are the primary mechanisms for phosphorus trapping in VFS.

AB  - ABSTRACT We studied the effects of periodic disturbance (prescribed burning and light disking) and landscape composition on nest density and success for grassland birds in agricultural conservation buffers in southeastern United States agroecosystems. During the 2007-2009 breeding seasons, we located 387 nests in buffers of a northeast Mississippi agroecosystem. Dickcissel ( Spiza americana) and red-winged blackbird ( Agelaius phoeniceus) were the most common nesting species. Time since disturbance influenced nest densities of dickcissels and red-winged blackbirds; densities were lesser during the first growing season post-disturbance but increased during the second growing season post-burn. Nest densities for both species were least in buffers adjacent to woodland. Inclusion of disturbance did not improve models of dickcissel and red-winged blackbird nest survival, suggesting that disturbance influenced nesting density, but not nesting outcomes. Amount of grassland surrounding dickcissel nests was positively associated with nest survival, but confidence intervals included zero indicating effects were not strong. Although distance to nearest crop or developed edge were included in competing models of red-winged blackbird nest survival, their effects were negligible. Agricultural conservation buffers will best serve breeding grassland bird populations if they are established in areas with minimal woodland cover, maximize total grassland in the landscape, and are maintained with prescribed burning. These results will help characterize the contribution of agricultural conservation buffers in agroecosystems of the southeastern United States. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Although prairies and conservation buffers are becoming popular to improve soil properties and environmental quality, very little is known about their influence on soil thermal properties. This study compared and quantified thermal conductivity (lambda), thermal diffusivity (D), and volumetric heat capacity (C) of prairies (Tucker Prairie [TP] and Prairie Fork [PF]), conservation buffers (grass buffers [GB] and agroforestry buffers [AGF]), and corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation (COS) land uses in Missouri. Core and bulk soils were collected at 10-cm depth increments. Soil thermal properties and water characteristic curves were determined at 0, -33, -100, and -300 kPa pressures. Additionally, soil organic C (SOC) and bulk density (BD) were also determined. The results showed that SOC was negatively correlated with lambda and D and positively correlated with C. Significantly higher values of SOC and lower BD were observed for AGF, TP, GB, and PF than COS. Similarly, lambda and D were significantly higher and C was lower under COS than the prairies and conservation buffers. The results suggest that a greater amount of SOC decreases the thermal conductance due to the insulating characteristics of SOC and acts as a barrier to heat transport. Therefore, AGF, TP, GB, and PF had lower thermal conductance to deeper soil depths, which helps to conserve more moisture as well as assist in increasing the longevity of SOC in the soil matrix. Our results imply that buffers and perennial vegetation can help reduce heat flow by increasing the thermal capacity and thereby mitigating climate change.

AB  - Riparian buffer zones have the potential to capture chemical contaminants and to mitigate detrimental side-effects in aquatic ecosystems derived from excess fertilizers used in agro-food production. No-till farming systems are well known agricultural practices and are widely used in temperate areas. In that regard, different settings and widths of riparian buffer zones (12, 24, 36,48 and 60 m) with woody vegetation, shrubs or grasses were assessed. The methodology was comprised of the evaluation of a large number of experimental sites and the sampling was conducted after the first rain period and respective fertilizer applications. The results point to the fact that effectiveness is largely controlled by buffer zone width and vegetation type. Indeed, buffer zones with 60 m width composed of woody soils were more effective in phosphorus (99.9%) and nitrogen (99.9%) removal when compared to shrub (66.4% and 83.9%, respectively) or grass vegetation (52.9% and 61.6%, respectively) areas. Woody vegetation has deep rooting systems and woody soils have a higher content of organic matter when compared to grass and shrubs areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diuraphis noxia (the Russian wheat aphid) severely damages winter wheat, which is typically grown in alternating 30-70 m wide strips of wheat and fallow ground (traditional rotation) in the western region of the North American Great Plains. Diversification of this production system occurs by adding a spring sown plant such as sunflower into the strip rotation (diversified rotation). Converting idle wheat land to grassland adds to plant diversity. Wheat production in the North American Great Plains is of an impressive scale (for each field, possibly 10 or more strips of several kilometers in length), but plant diversity occurs, particularly in the western region where diversified rotations and idle wheat land conversion to grassland are becoming more common. The 'Enemies Hypothesis' predicts a greater number of polyphagous natural enemies of insects in areas of high plant diversity. This hypothesis appeared to be valid for the 'specialist' aphid parasitoids Diaeretiella rapae and Aphelinus albipodus that were released to control D. noxia. A. albipodus was often more abundant along edges of wheat and sunflower strips of the diversified rotation than along edges of wheat of the traditional rotation. D. rapae was less abundant and principally found on sunflower and wheat of the diversified rotation. Parasitoids were often found in grassland adjacent to wheat at levels similar to those of the diversified rotation. The abundance of five aphid species on wheat was low in both rotations, and aphids on sunflower did not pose a threat to wheat health. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigated, over the course of 2 years, the spatial distribution and abundance of two species of aphid, Metopolophium dirhodum and Sitobion avenae, and predatory species of carabid. This was undertaken in 24 wheat fields in 'coarse-grain' and 'fine-grain' landscapes in western France. A greater percentage of the latter landscape was covered by hedgerows and grassland and the total area covered by fields and the average size of the fields were smaller., The effects on aphid abundance of the distance from field margins, the presence of grassy strips and carabid abundance were determined in both landscapes., Both aphid species were more abundant in the 'fine-grain' landscape, which may have been a result of the higher density of semi-natural elements. In both types of landscape, the total numbers of aphids were negatively correlated with the distance from the field margin. This may have been because aphids were dispersing from overwintering sites in field margins. The abundance of M. dirhodum was strongly negatively correlated with the presence of grassy strips in the 'coarse-grain' landscape, although there were no such significant correlations for either of the aphid species in the 'fine-grain' landscape., Aphid and carabid abundances were negatively correlated in the 'fine-grain' and positively in 'coarse-grain' landscape., The results obtained in the present study emphasize the importance of semi-natural areas in agricultural landscapes in shaping the spatial distribution of aphids and carabid beetles, their natural enemies, at different spatial scales.

AB  - Surface water contamination can often be reduced by passing runoff water through perennial grass filters. Research was conducted in 2006 to 2008 to evaluate the size of cool season grass filters consisting primarily of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb) with some orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata L.) relative to drainage area size in reducing runoff sediment and phosphorus (P). The soil was Pohocco silt loam Typic Eutrochrepts with a median slope of 5.5 %. The grass filters occupying 1.1 and 4.3 % of the plot area were compared with no filter with four replications. The filters were planted in the V-shaped plot outlets which were 3.7x11.0 m in size. The filter effect on sediment and P concentration was determined from four natural runoff events when nearly all plots had runoff. Filter effect on runoff volume and contaminant load was determined using total runoff and composites of samples collected from 12 runoff events. Sediment concentration was reduced by 25 % with filters compared with no filter (from 1.10 to 1.47 gL(-1)), but P concentration was not affected. The 1.1 and 4.3 % filters, respectively, compared with having no grass filter, reduced: runoff volume by 54 and 79 %; sediment load by 67 and 84 % (357 to 58 kgha(-1)); total P load by 68 and 76 % (0.58 to 0.14 kgha(-1)); particulate P (PP) load by 66 and 82 % (0.39 to 0.07 kgha(-1)); and dissolved reactive P (DRP) load by 73 and 66 % (0.2 to 0.07 kgha(-1)), respectfully. A snowmelt runoff event had 56 % greater DRP concentration compared with rainfall-induced runoff events. Grass filters reduced sediment and P load largely by reducing runoff volume rather than reducing concentration. Well-designed and well-placed grass filters that occupy 1.0 to 1.5 % of the drainage area and intercept a uniform flow of runoff from a drainage area can reduce sediment and nutrient loss in runoff by greater than 50 %.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the factors driving diversity and abundance of small rodent species inhabiting permanent linear habitat patches within high-intensified agricultural landscapes of western France. Multivariate (co-inertia) analysis was used to analyse relationships of habitat and landscape descriptive variables with rodent records. Two main ecological gradients were recognized according to statistical analysis. Relationships of species occurrence with environmental factors were interpreted according to their main life traits. The first ecological gradient clearly differentiated communities from hedges to those of grass-dominated linear banks. This first gradient was associated with the prevalence of forest versus grassland rodent species. This partitioning seems to reflect rather ecological requirements of species than competitive interactions. Small rodents diversity and abundance were inversely evolving along this gradient. The second factor influencing species assemblages was associated to landscape heterogeneity surrounding the permanent habitats. According to this second gradient, species seemed to be selected in relation to their ability to disperse and to use cultivated fields. Maximum diversity was generally observed in heterogeneous permanent habitats with mixed vegetation structure but hedges are important to produce biomass for predators.

AB  - Studies of the effects of modern agriculture on biodiversity have generally lacked a historical perspective. Field margins have considerable ecological significance in agriculture-dominated landscapes, but are affected by interaction with management practices in the margin and on adjoining land. This study investigated the time period over which changes in management practices best explains the occurrence of 40 plant species now commonly found in 311 field margins of Zone Atelier Armorique, Brittany, France. Five management practices were surveyed every year since 1995. Species occurrence was recorded in 2007, 2011 and 2013 and related by means of GLMMs to management practices over time, up to a maximum of 12 years, i.e., scores of field margins on the two first axes of correspondence analysis (CA) performed on management practices. Model selection using AIC criteria allowed us to identify the time period over which to consider management practices that best explain plant patterns. For one third of the common 40 plant species recorded, the time period over which to consider management practices was greater than one year. The rest of the species showed inconsistent patterns with high level of variability between 2007, 2011 and 2013. The time period tended to be longer for species with vegetative reproduction and for zoochorous species. Our results show that the long-term simultaneous monitoring of both vegetation and management practices is important to understand some ecological patterns that would be missed either in short-term studies or for studies that exclude management information. Our findings contribute to long-term strategies for management and conservation of field margins diversity by highlighting that different plant groups require management on particular timescales.

AB  - Agricultural ecosystems have faced dramatic changes during past decades, resulting in a dramatic loss of farmland biodiversity. The Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra is considered a suitable indicator for the conservation value of farmland habitats, and has recently suffered strong declines throughout much of its European range. As a basis for targeted conservation measures, we investigated the habitat preferences of this species in north-eastern Germany by comparing the composition of male territories with randomly chosen control sites. A territory was defined as the area within a radius of 150 meters around the assumed centre of the territory, as the majority of nests is found within this radius. To assess food availability for nestlings, arthropod abundance within the most abundant land use types i.e. crop fields, fallows, grassland as well as within unploughed strips was investigated. In total we found 102 male Corn Bunting territories, which were mainly composed of crop fields (50%), grassland (28%), and fallows (12%). Territories compared with control sites were characterized by a lower proportion of crop fields, a higher proportion of fallows, more diverse land use types, more abundant field boundaries, unploughed strips, and tracks, and a higher availability of song posts. However, neither the number of larger (>= 1 cm), smaller (< 1 cm) or all arthropods differed significantly among analysed land use types i.e. crop fields, fallows, grassland, unploughed strips. Our study confirms the significance of habitat heterogeneity and especially of sites with sparse vegetation (fallows > 10%) and song posts (> 70 m 'linear song posts' or > 1 solitary post per ha) for the habitat selection of male Corn Buntings. We conclude that measures to halt population declines of Corn Buntings seem to be relatively easy to implement, provided that farmers are granted a fair compensation.

AB  - Hedgerows are an important semi-natural habitat for invertebrates and other wildlife within agricultural landscapes. Hedgerow quality can be greatly affected either by over- or under-management. Neglect of hedgerows is an increasingly important issue as traditional management techniques such as hedgelaying become economically unviable. In the UK, funding for hedge management is available under agri-environment schemes but relatively little is known about how this impacts on wider biodiversity. We used a randomised block experiment to investigate how habitat structural change, arising from a range of techniques to rejuvenate hedgerows (including more economic/mechanised alternatives to traditional hedgelaying), affected invertebrate abundance and diversity. We combined digital image analysis with estimates of foliage biomass and quality to show which aspects of hedge structure were most affected by the rejuvenation treatments. All investigated aspects of habitat structure varied considerably with management type, though the abundance of herbivores and predators was affected primarily by foliage density. Detritivore abundance was most strongly correlated with variation in hedge gap size. The results suggest that habitat structure is an important organising force in invertebrate community interactions and that management technique may affect trophic groups differently. Specifically we find that alternative methods of hedgerow rejuvenation could support abundances of invertebrates comparable or even higher than traditional hedgelaying, with positive implications for the restoration of a larger area of hedgerow habitat on a limited budget. © 2015 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.

AB  - The content of microbial biomass (MB) was determined in samples of gray forest, chestnut, and tundra soils with different physicochemical properties (0.4-22.7% Corg; 8.4-26.8% silt particles; pH 4.3-8.4) by the methods of substrate-induced respiration (MB(SIR)) and direct microscopy (MB(M)). The samples of two upper soil layers, 0-5 and 5-10 cm (without plant litter), from different ecosystems (forest, forest shelter belt, meadow, fallow, and arable land) and elements of relief of interfluvial tundra (block/upper land plateau, depression between blocks) have been analyzed. The content of microbial biomass in the 0-5-cm soil layer was 216-8134 and 348-7513 microg C/g soil as measured by the methods of substrate-induced respiration and direct microscopy, respectively. The MB(SIR) and MB(M) values closely correlated with each other: r = 0.90 and 0.74 for 0-5 and 5-10 cm, respectively. The average MB(SIR)/MB(M) ratio was 90 and 60% for 0-5 and 5-10 cm, respectively. The portion of microbial carbon in total organic soil carbon was, on average, 4 and 3% (SIR) and 5 and 7% (direct microscopy) for 0-5 and 5-10 cm, respectively. Possible reasons for the differences between MB(SIR) and MB(M) values in the soils under study are discussed.

AB  -. 1. Arthropods, a major component of functional biodiversity within agro-ecosystems, contribute to sustainability through processes including nutrient cycling and pest control. Extensively managed field margins can help protect this functional biodiversity by providing habitat for beneficial species. 2. This 2 year study investigated the relative benefits of grassland field margin treatments (Fenced only, Rotavated, and Reseeded (with a grass and wildflower mixture)) on the abundance and taxon richness of five arthropod trophic groups (detritivores, herbivores, predators, parasitoids and hyperparasitoids) from the orders Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera and Araneae. 3. The taxon richness and abundance of all trophic groups (with the exception of herbivore abundance) was greater in fenced field margin treatments than in the adjacent grazed field, particularly by the final sampling occasion. However, there were seasonal differences, with abundance and taxon richness generally greater in August than in June. Only detritivores and herbivores responded to the individual fenced field margin treatments. The botanically more species rich, rotavated and reseeded treatments, had greater detritivore and herbivore richness and abundance than the fenced only treatments. 4. Community structure analysis indicated that the grazed (within) field and fenced field margins had two distinct communities for all trophic groups, demonstrating the conservation value of the margins within intensively managed agricultural grasslands. 5. The current Irish agri-environment scheme requires fencing of field margins. Our results highlight how this relatively simple measure can benefit arthropod conservation and functional biodiversity. This may in turn benefit farm productivity through potentially improved nutrient cycling and natural pest control.

AB  - Agroforestry practices are receiving increased attention in temperate zones due to their environmental and economic benefits. To test the hypothesis that agroforestry buffers reduce runoff by increased infiltration, water use, and water storage; profile water content and soil water infiltration were measured for a Putnam soil (fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Albaqualf). The watershed was under no-till management with a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation since 1991. Agroforestry buffer strips, 4.5 m wide and 36.5 m apart, were planted with redtop (Agrostis gigantea Roth), brome (Bromus spp.), and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.). Pin oak (Quercus palustris Muenchh.), swamp white oak (Q. bicolor Willd.) and bur oak (Q. macrocarpa Michx.) trees were planted at 3-m intervals in the center of the agroforestry buffers in 1997. Ponded water infiltration was measured in agroforestry and grass buffers and row crop areas. Water content in agroforestry and row crop areas at 5, 10, 20, and 40 cm depths were measured throughout the year. Quasi-steady infiltration rates were not different (P > 0.05) among the treatments. Agroforestry had lower soil water content than row crop areas (P < 0.05) during the growing season. Higher water content after the principal recharge event in the agroforestry treatment was attributed to better infiltration through the root system. Results show that agroforestry buffer strips reduce soil water content during critical times such as fallow periods, and increase water infiltration and water storage. Therefore, adoption of agroforestry buffer practices may reduce runoff and soil loss from watersheds in row crop management.

AB  - Semi-natural habitats are part of agri-environment programmes throughout Europe. Little is known about activity-density and assemblage composition of carabid beetles within sown wildflower areas ( SWA) compared with conventional grassy field margins and adjoining arable fields., In 10 landscapes, two pairs of winter wheat fields with adjoining SWA and grassy field margin were studied. We compared activity-density, species richness, ecological traits and assemblage composition of carabids among 20 winter wheat fields, 10 adjoining grassy field margins and 10 adjoining SWA., Beetle activity-density was higher in wheat fields compared with adjoining semi-natural habitats regarding total carabids, macropterous, polyphagous-carnivorous and euryoecious open habitat beetles. Although total species richness (analysis of variance) did not significantly differ among habitat types, we found significantly higher species numbers in SWA than in wheat fields adjoining SWA and grassy margins when the number of recorded species was standardized to the number of individuals (rarefaction). Carabid assemblages in wheat fields differed from assemblages in adjoining SWA and grassy margins., The results of the present study emphasize the important contribution of semi-natural habitats to diversify the spring carabid fauna in agroecosystems. In particular, SWA were shown to be useful to enhance carabid biodiversity conservation in agroecosystems, rather than to enhance their density-dependent functions.

AB  - 1 The influence of within-field position and adjoining habitat on carabid beetles was studied in 20 winter wheat fields in ten different Swiss agricultural landscapes. In each landscape, two winter wheat fields (one with adjoining sown wildflower area and one with adjoining grassy margin) were investigated. 2 Carabid beetles were caught in pitfall traps 3 and 30 m from the edge in each of the 20 wheat fields. Significantly more individuals were found in the centres (30-m position) than at the edges (3-m position). Conversely, species richness was significantly higher at the field edges than in the centres. 3 Of the ten most abundant species, Poecilus cupreus, Agonum muelleri and Pterostichus melanarius were significantly more abundant in the field centres than at the edges. Harpalus rufipes was significantly more abundant in the fields adjoining sown wildflower areas than in the fields adjoining grassy margins. 4 In conclusion, the response of carabid beetles to within-field position and adjoining habitats was species specific. This needs to be taken into account in habitat management for biodiversity conservation and pest control.

AB  - N and C cycles in headwater streams are coupled, and land use can modify these cycles by increasing N availability and removing riparian vegetation. To increase our understanding of how land use modifies the controls on N cycling, we quantified rates of 2 microbial N transformations in a total of 18 agricultural and urban streams (with and without riparian buffers) for 3 y to examine how riparian vegetation and land use influence sediment nitrification and denitrification. Nitrification rates were highest in agricultural streams in late spring. Nitrification was not related to streamwater NH4+ concentrations but was positively related to sediment C content (linear regression, r(2) = 0.72, p < 0.001). This result suggests that benthic decomposition provided NH4+ (via mineralization) to increase sediment nitrification. Denitrification rates did not differ among landuse types but were positively related to sediment C content and streamwater NO3- concentration (multiple linear regression, R-2 = 0.78, p < 0.001). Sediment C content, the primary predictor of denitrification rates, did not differ among land uses, but strearnwater NO3- concentration, the secondary predictor of denitrification rates, was highest in winter and in agricultural streams, indicating that land use and season were more important determinants of denitrification than coupled nitrification. Substrate availability (N and Q for N transformations generally did not differ between buffered and unbuffered streams within a similar landuse type, probably because of the confounding influence of tile drainage systems, which effectively decouple stream channels from their riparian zones. Land use influenced the delivery of the necessary substrates for N transformations but decreased the role of riparian zones in stream N cycling by simplifying the drainage network of headwater streams.

AB  - The use of plastic row covers (plastic mulch) on vegetable farms increases runoff of pesticides after rainfall events and has been linked to toxic events in adjacent tidal waters. In coastal Virginia, USA, runoff from tomato fields with plastic mulch was suspected of causing mortality of commercial hard clam larvae at a hatchery located downstream of farming operations. Concern about the putative impacts of this practice on local waters resulted in a collection of studies to: (1) determine the sensitivity of early life stages of bivalves to copper, a commonly used fungicide; (2) examine acute and chronic biological effects of runoff on tidal creeks; and (3) examine the efficacy of management practices designed to reduce the delivery of pesticides to adjacent creeks. Laboratory bioassays revealed that 48-h LC50 values for embryonic clams Mulinia lateralis and Mercenaria mercenaria were 38 and 20 μg/l, respectively. In situ bioassays with Palaemonetes pugio showed that pulsed toxic conditions sometimes occur downstream of some tomato farms in plastic mulch following rainfall events. Growth, mortality rates and bioaccumulation of copper and organic pesticides in oysters were not correlated with the use of plastic mulch in watersheds. Sediment bioassays indicated potential toxicity in sediment collected downstream of some tomato fields in plastic mulch, but the effects were not consistent between years. Closer examination of management practices on the farms suggests that controlling runoff can prevent toxic impacts. Elevated levels of crop protectants measured at the outflow of farm ponds suggested that they may do little to reduce loadings of some pesticides. However, forested buffer zones and ephemeral sedimentation basins appeared to be effective in reducing pesticide concentrations in runoff and pulsed toxicity in tidal creeks.

AB  - The number of birds found in 37 (5 ha) sites on farmland in Cambridgeshire were counted. In winter, average number of species per site increased from 5 on arable land to 7.5 when a ditch was present; numbers increased with the additional presence of short hedges or trees to 12 species. With tall hedges the number was 17 and with a narrow strip of woodland 19. The number of resident thrushes, buntings, and robin + wren, and dunnock were all significantly different in different types of habitat. The basic pattern was the same in summer. In winter the nature of the surrounding 2.5 km2 significantly influenced numbers of most groups of species, but accounted for little (&lt;30%) of the variation in numbers. Numbers of resident thrushes, wrens and robins increased with increased ditch volume. Hedge height was not important for these species but was important for tits. More of the variation in numbers of a species present in summer was accounted for by both characteristics of the surrounding countryside and the ditches and hedges themselves than was the case in winter.-from Author

AB  - Several processes take place within vegetated buffer strips that affect their performance. To better understand these processes, a runoff study was conducted to evaluate vegetated buffer strips performance in reducing atrazine, metolachlor, and chlorpyrifos transport as affected by the drainage area to buffer strip area ratio. The simulated runoff water mixed with pesticide-treated soil was distributed onto six vegetated buffer strips, each 1.52 m wide X 20.12 m long, located downslope of the inflow distribution tank in a well established vegetated grassed waterway. These strips provided for three replications of two inflow rates designated as "drainage area/buffer strip area ratio treatments" of 15:1 and 30:1. Infiltration for the 15:1 treatment averaged 38.8% of the inflow volume, whereas it averaged 30.4% for the 30:1 treatment. Sediment retention efficiencies averaged 90.1% and 86.8% for the 15:1 and 30:1 treatments, respectively. Concentrations of atrazine and metolachlor associated with sediment outflows from the strips were larger than their respective inflow concentrations, while the results were opposite for chlorpyrifos. Concentrations in runoff water for both atrazine and metolachlor in outflow from the strips were smaller than the inflow concentrations; again, the results were opposite for chlorpyrifos. The 15:1 treatment retained an average of 52.5% of the total input of atrazine, 54.4% of metolachlor, and 83.1% of chlorpyrifos. Corresponding numbers for the 30:1 treatment were 46.8% for atrazine, 48.1% for metolachlor, and 76.9% for chlorpyrifos. Analysis of variance using the randomized block design showed that differences of percent retention of pesticide between treatments were not significant for any of the three pesticides at the 10% significance level. A lack of significant difference indicates either a need for more than three replications and/or larger area ratio treatments to be studied. The results of this study indicate that a 30:1 area ratio buffer strip could perform equally as well as a 15:1 area ratio buffer strip. Thus, less land would be required under buffer strips to get the desired results.

AB  - Effectiveness of vegetative buffer strips for herbicide retention from agricultural runoff was evaluated in a two-year natural rainfall study. A source area of 0.41 ha (mainly Canisteo silty clay loan soil), having an average slope of 3%, was fall chisel-plowed, spring disked, and planted to corn. Three herbicides (atrazine, metolachlor; and cyanazine) were applied to the source area in each spring. Six vegetative buffer strips, 1.52 m widex20.12 m long, were isolated with metal borders downslope of the source area in a well established bromegrass (Bromus inermis) waterway These strips provided for three replications of two drainage to buffer area ratio treatments of 15:1 and 30:1. Herbicide retention was dependent on the antecedent moisture conditions of the strips. These retentions ranged from 11 to 100% for atrazine, 16 to 100% for metolachlor; and 8 to 100% for cyanazine. Herbicide retention by the buffer strips for the two treatments were not significantly different for the observed storm events. Herbicide concentrations in solution in outflow from the strips were less than the inflow concentrations for all the three herbicides. Infiltration was the key process for herbicide retention by the buffer strips, although there war some adsorption to in-place soil and/or vegetation. Metolachlor concentrations in sediment increased in outflow for the two treatments; however the opposite was true for atrazine and cyanazine. Herbicide retention by sediment deposition in the strip represented about 5% of the total herbicide retention by the buffer strips. The buffer strips were found to have high percent sediment retention, ranging from 40 to 100%; thus, the strips would be more effective for retaining strongly adsorbed herbicides.

AB  - Small mammals make up an important link in the food chain as many predator species feed on them. There are indications that small mammal populations in Europe are declining due to the intensification of agriculture. According to national legislation, farmers in Switzerland have to cultivate at least 7% of their land as ecological compensation areas and, thus, some alternative habitats that are possibly beneficial for small mammals have been created. In this study, we estimated the diversity and density of small mammals on two types of conventional farmland field types (artificial grassland and autumn-sown wheat) and three types of ecological compensation areas (wild-flower strips, herbaceous strips and low-intensity meadows) by use of capture-recapture in March, May and July 2003. The common vole Microtus arvalis was the most abundant and predominant species in all habitat types except in herbaceous strips, which harboured the highest diversity with six species caught. In March the density of small mammals was generally very low, but significantly higher in wild-flower (mainly due to common vole) and herbaceous strips than in the other habitat types. In wild-flower and herbaceous strips, densities increased strongly from March to May and in July. On autumn-sown wheat fields, a strong increase occurred only from May to July and was caused by common vole. On artificial grassland and lowintensity meadows, densities of small mammals (mainly common vole) increased only marginally with low-intensity meadows supporting slightly higher densities. Thus, habitats that were not mown each year supported the highest densities of small mammals. This demonstrates that ecological compensation areas, such as wild-flower and herbaceous strips, make up an important refuge for small mammals. They probably also have positive effects on populations of many predator species that depend on small mammals, particularly if a mosaic with mown surfaces is created.

AB  - Abstract: The barn owl Tyto alba has been in decline throughout much of its range largely as a consequence of loss of foraging habitat resulting from agricultural intensification. The recent introduction of agri-environment schemes in the UK has resulted in the reinstatement of substantial areas of rough grassland which may be of benefit to small mammals and their avian predators. In this study mature grasslands provided by agri-environmental schemes (farm woodlands, permanent set-aside, 2 and 6m field margins) were compared to better understand which hold the greatest prey numbers and how new areas of grassland targeted at barn owl conservation should be created and managed. In all habitats apart from farm woodlands, small mammal numbers were positively associated with taller swards. This study suggests that areas cut every 2 or 3 years supported more individuals and species than areas cut annually, although this trend was only significant for common shrews. With the introduction of the new Environmental Stewardship scheme in 2005, our results suggest that the area of suitable foraging habitat for barn owls is likely to increase.

AB  - A study of the impact of various field margin and field attributes on carabid beetle communities was implemented at IGER (North Wyke). Carabid beetles were caught in pitfall traps placed 0.5 m from either a hedge or a post and wire fence in 16 grassland field margins. The data were collected over the season April-mid November 1990. The relationship of the beetle assemblages to measurements of species numbers of field margin flora, sward husbandry, sward characteristics and physical attributes of the field margin itself was investigated. Contrary to expectations most species caught did not seem to be correlated to any measured variable. The majority of species trapped were present in both the hedge and fence field margins. However, a notable percentage (29.4) were present exclusively in the hedge margins, for example, Leistus fulvibarbis and Trechus obtusus. When the data were analysed by detrended correspondence analysis the margins were separated according to the soil moisture content and number of plant species in the margin; grazing regime and age of the pasture they surrounded.

AB  - Field margin plots, sown with either a simple grass mix, a complex grass mix with or without forbs or allowed to regenerate naturally were established around four fields on the Royal Agricultural College’s Harnhill farm in the west of England. Two of the fields were managed conventionally and two were managed organically. Plants and invertebrates were recorded on the margin plots over a 2 year period to test the influence of the different mixtures on the community assemblages. There was no difference in the seed bank of the different plot types, however the organically managed margins contained more unsown species than the conventionally managed margins.The simple mix plots had significantly fewer plant species than the other plots. The naturally regenerating plots had significantly lower grass cover and grass species diversity than the other plots. In the second year perennial grass and perennial forb cover increased in all mixtures. Both the cover and numbers of unsown species were reduced in the sown plots in the second year. Percentage cover and species richness of forbs were significantly higher in the complex grass with forbs and naturally regenerating plots.Auchenorrhyncha, Heteroptera and Araneae abundance were significantly correlated with plant species richness. Also, both plant species richness and total plant cover significantly influenced the Auchenorrhyncha community. Invertebrate abundance was greater in the organically managed plots than in the conventional ones, except larval Coleoptera.In the second year significantly more predatory Coleoptera species were trapped in the natural regeneration plots. Farming system and field crop type influenced the Coleoptera communities, phytophagous Coleopteran diversity being significantly correlated with plant diversity. Sowing field margins with a complex seed mixture with some forb species and managing the field with reduced inputs suppressed undesirable plant species and increased invertebrate abundance and diversity.A mixture containing forbs increased plant species richness and maximised heterogeneity of the margin, providing a more diverse habitat for invertebrates.

AB  - The influence of weedy field strips on the abundance patterns of western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), and predatory bugs of Orius spp. (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), on faba bean and on weeds was investigated in Adana province, Turkey, during 2005-2006. There were two treatments: in one treatment, weeds at the margins and inside the plots were regularly controlled by tillage; in the other treatment no weed control was done. Thrips and Orius were sampled by beating faba bean plants and weeds. Orius niger (Wolff) was the most abundant predatory insect species in faba bean and flowering weeds, with numbers of adults and nymphs significantly greater in plots with weedy margins than in weed-free plots. Flowering weeds did not contribute to the abundance of F. occidentalis on faba bean. Abundance of adults of Orius spp. did not coincide with the abundance of F. occidentalis on faba bean or weeds. There were significant negative associations for numbers of Orius spp. among faba bean and the weed species Lamium amplexicaule L. or Sinapis arvensis L. (P < 0.05), indicating movement of Orius individuals from the weeds to faba bean during March-April. Finally, faba bean and weeds may provide some benefits to predators, such as nectar, pollen, shelter and egg-laying sites rather than as sources of insect prey. Cultivation of faba bean could be useful for conservation and augmentation of beneficial insects, including Orius spp. Furthermore, field margins bearing flowering weeds such as S. arvensis and L amplexicaule should be protected against destructive management practices, because they host considerable numbers of the Orius species.

AB  - The effects of habitat restoration measures designated to promote farmland biodiversity have been documented at the field scale, but little is known about their role in restoring the agricultural mosaic. In this study, we analyzed the effects of wildflower strips (WFS) at the field scale and in the landscape context on butterflies in a Swiss arable landscape. Three hypotheses were tested: (1) butterfly diversity and abundance are higher in WFS than in conventional fields; (2) butterfly diversity and abundance are enhanced by the amount, proximity and connectivity of WFS in the landscape context; (3) additional factors influence butterfly diversity and abundance according to individual site conditions and landscape context characteristics linked to other landscape elements. WFS had more species and individuals of butterflies than conventional habitats. However, promoted species were mainly generalists; few specialists were enhanced. The diversity of all butterflies and of generalists increased linearly with percent cover of WFS, reflecting an effect of restoration measures depending on the landscape context. The influence of proximity and connectivity of WFS were, however, not significant. The occurrence of specialists was conditioned by plant species richness, while the effect of WFS for overall diversity was affected by the amount of grassland in the surroundings. We conclude that to increase the effectiveness of biodiversity-orientated restoration measures, their implementation should be steered toward increasing the share of WFS in the landscape. However, the combination of WFS with additional restoration measures might be needed to halt the decline of specialist species.

AB  - Of all non-arable habitats, field margins are the most important ones for bumblebees in agricultural environment, especially as they are wide-spread and offer food resources, but they are also places for reproduction and overwintering. This study was made to investigate bumblebee abundance in the agricultural environment and to obtain information on the use of southern Finnish field margins by bumblebees. Bumblebees and cuckoo bumblebees were studied in a farmland area in Lammi, southern Finland, in 1996. Line-transect counts in field margins were made to compare habitat availability of patches of farmland and qualities of field margins within the patches. Landscape variables, dicotyledonous flower abundances and ecological and morphological characteristics of flowers were used as factors to explain variation in bumblebee assemblages and their frequencies of visits to the field margins. Bumblebee species richness and total density were higher in patches of farmland where field margins had more dicotyledonous flowers rather than being grassy. Abundance and flowering phenology of a limited number of flower species during the bumblebee breeding season were the most important factors explaining bumblebee visits in field margins. The most important flower species was zigzag clover (Trifolium medium). The width of field margins was significantly related to the total density of bumblebees and cuckoo bumblebees, but not species number or diversity.

AB  - Abstract: This study assessed the benefits of sown grass strips on grasshopper communities in intensive farmland, and the effects of farming practices and landscape context. Results showed that sown grass strips were high quality habitats for grasshoppers compared to grasslands. Farming practices influenced grasshopper densities in sown grass strips while landscape context affected more the species richness of grasshoppers. Sown mixture and cutting export option were the main factors driving grasshopper density. Mixtures composed of grasses without legumes were the best, as well as hay export compared to no export. Increased grasshopper species richness occurred in sown grass strips located in landscapes with low grassland field availability and high connectivity. Enhanced use of sown grass strips by grasshoppers can be seen as a direct effect of establishment and management options, but also as an effect of the rarity and instability of other grassland habitats in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Grasshoppers are important components of grassland invertebrate communities, particularly as nutrient recyclers and as prey for many bird species. Sown margin strips are key features of agri-environmental schemes in European agricultural landscapes and have been shown to benefit grasshoppers depending on the initial sown seed mixture. Understanding the mechanisms by which the sown mixture impacts grasshoppers in sown margin strips is the aim of our study. Here, we investigated plant-grasshopper interactions in sown margin strips and the respective effects of plant identity and diversity on grasshoppers. We surveyed plants and grasshoppers in 44 sown margin strips located in Western France which were initially established with three sowing mixtures dominated, respectively, by alfalfa, Festuca rubra and Lolium perenne and Festuca arundinacea. Grasshopper species contrasted in their response to plant diversity and to the abundance of sown and non-sown plant species. Some grasshopper species were positively correlated with the abundance of grass and especially of a single sown plant species, F. rubra. In contrast, other grasshopper species benefited from high plant diversity likely due to their high degree of polyphagy. At the community level, these contrasted responses were translated into a positive linear relationship between grass cover and grasshopper abundance and into a quadratic relationship between plant diversity and grasshopper diversity or abundance. Since plant identity and diversity are driven by the initial sown mixture, our study suggests that by optimizing the seed mixture, it is possible to manage grasshopper diversity or abundance in sown margin strips.

AB  - Soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura) is a severe pest of soybean in central North America. Outbreaks of the aphid in Ontario are often spotty in distribution, with some geographical areas affected severely and others with few or no aphid populations occurring in soybean for the duration of the season. A. glycines spend summers on soybean and overwinter on buckthorn, a shrub that is widespread in southern Ontario and is commonly found in agricultural hedgerows and at the margins of woodlots. A. glycines likely use both short distance migratory flights from buckthorn and longer distance dispersal flights in the search for acceptable summer hosts. This study aims to model colonization of soybean fields by A. glycines engaged in early-season migration from overwintering hosts. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was used to rank numerous competing linear and probit models using field parameters to predict aphid presence, colonization, and density. The variable that best modeled aphid density in soybean fields in the early season was the ratio of buckthorn density to field area, although dramatic differences in relationships between the parameters were observed between study years. This study has important applications in predicting areas that are at elevated risk of developing economically damaging populations of soybean aphid and which may act as sources for further infestation. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.

AB  - The Mitigation Options for Phosphorus and Sediment (MOPS) project investigated the effectiveness of within-field control measures (tramline management, straw residue management, type of cultivation and direction, and vegetative buffers) in terms of mitigating sediment and phosphorus loss from winter-sown combinable cereal crops using three case study sites. To determine the cost of the approaches, simple financial spreadsheet models were constructed at both farm and regional levels. Taking into account crop areas, crop rotation margins per hectare were calculated to reflect the costs of crop establishment, fertiliser and agro-chemical applications, harvesting, and the associated labour and machinery costs. Variable and operating costs associated with each mitigation option were then incorporated to demonstrate the impact on the relevant crop enterprise and crop rotation margins. These costs were then compared to runoff, sediment and phosphorus loss data obtained from monitoring hillslope-length scale field plots. Each of the mitigation options explored in this study had potential for reducing sediment and phosphorus losses from arable land under cereal crops. Sediment losses were reduced from between 9 kg ha(-1) to as much as 4780 kg ha(-1) with a corresponding reduction in phosphorus loss from 0.03 kg ha(-1) to 2.89 kg ha(-1). In percentage terms reductions of phosphorus were between 9% and 99%. Impacts on crop rotation margins also varied. Minimum tillage resulted in cost savings (up to 50 pound ha(-1)) whilst other options showed increased costs (up to 19 pound ha(-1) for straw residue incorporation). Overall, the results indicate that each of the options has potential for on-farm implementation. However, tramline management appeared to have the greatest potential for reducing runoff, sediment, and phosphorus losses from arable land (between 69% and 99%) and is likely to be considered cost-effective with only a small additional cost of 2-4 pound ha(-1), although further work is needed to evaluate alternative tramline management methods. Tramline management is also the only option not incorporated within current policy mechanisms associated with reducing soil erosion and phosphorus loss and in light of its potential is an approach that should be encouraged once further evidence is available.

AB  - The effects of ten different management regimes on the abundance and species richness of Araneae on pre-existing and newly expanded zones of field margins surrounding arable fields are compared in a large-scale experiment conducted between 1987 and 1991. Most of the management regimes involved varying the timing and frequency with which the field margins were cut. There was no evidence of consistent temporal trends in the abundance and species richness of Araneae on either the existing or expanded zones of the field margins during the first four years of the experiment. However, lowest numbers were recorded before expansion of the margins in 1987, and highest numbers in the final sample, in 1991. Araneae remained less abundant, and less species rich, on the newly expanded than on the existing zones of the field margins four years after they were 'set-aside'. Cutting reduced both abundance and species richness. Regimes which included cutting in mid-summer had a greater impact which persisted for longer than did those involving cutting in spring and autumn. Removal of cut material was associated with lower species richness than leaving it in situ. Sowing the margins with a wild flower seed mixture was associated with increased abundance and species richness of Araneae, Annual spraying with a broad-spectrum, non-persistent herbicide reduced the abundance of Araneae but the effect was not detectable until several months after the application of the spray. Both the species richness and abundance of Araneae were positively correlated with a measure of vegetation height made on the field margins in September, on both the pre-existing and newly expanded zones of the margins. The extent to which management practices which benefit Araneae are compatible with both the management requirements for various other taxa, and the overriding constraint of effective pernicious weed control on field margins, is discussed.

AB  - 1. Agri-environment schemes (AES) are used extensively across Europe to address biodiversity declines in farmland. In England, Environmental Stewardship (ES) was introduced in 2005 to address the shortcomings of previous schemes, but as for schemes in other countries, assessments to date have revealed little evidence for national-scale biodiversity benefits. 2. Here, we assess the efficacy of ES in driving changes in national farmland bird populations over the period 20022010, using BTO/JNCC/RSPB Breeding Bird Survey data. We tested for associations between ES management options, grouped into categories reflecting intended biological effects (e.g. stubble), and species population growth rates, wherever benefits of management might be expected to occur. 3. We found strong evidence for positive effects of management that provides winter food resources (i.e. ES stubble and wild bird seed [WBS] crops) on population growth rates across multiple granivorous species, at three landscape scales. The results for management aiming to provide breeding season benefits (i.e. grassland, field margin and boundary [hedge, ditch] management) showed mixed patterns of positive and negative associations. 4. The results for stubble and WBS provide the first evidence for landscape-scale responses of biodiversity to AES management. The negative relationships identified may also show the importance of management context driving unforeseen predation or competition effects. 5. Synthesis and Applications. This study demonstrates that agri-environment scheme management has the potential to have national-scale effects on avian population growth rates, although our results suggest that some components of the scheme have had little effect on bird populations. Therefore, whilst this study provides the first proof-of-concept for broad-and-shallow scheme impacts on biodiversity, our results underline the importance of targeting towards population-limiting factors, here winter food resources. A combination of low uptake of key in-field options that provide winter seed and a failure to cover the late-winter period effectively explains the lack of national population responses. Such issues need to be addressed before schemes like Environmental Stewardship will achieve their goals. This study shows the value of feedback from monitoring for informing scheme design, through identifying problems and testing solutions.

AB  - The new trends in agricultural policy in Western Europe conduct to new management problems in maintaining and utilizing biological resources. In the South-Western France, the evolution of agricultural practices occurs in two opposite ways. On one hand, the intensification of agriculture leads to simplify the landscape by hedgerows removal, grasslands ploughing and drainage for corn cultivation. On the other hand, the decreasing numbers of cattle and sheep conduct the less fertile parts of the territory to evolve into fallow, These two processes are closely linked on a same territory and important interactions exist between intensive agricultural areas and semi-natural communities. To understand the importance of these interactions and their role in ecological stability of landscapes, we use passerine bird communities as an ecological indicator. We modelized the relationships between birds and landscape structure from 256 releves. Each releve includes a bird count point of 20 mn and a description of the landscape feature on the surrounding 6.25 ha. An ordination of the releves along the main ecological gradients was realized using Correspondence Analysis. Then, these ordinations where related to the landscape structure with Stepwise and Multiple Regression Analysis. The rate of woody area, the hedgerow network complexity and the rate of fallow land are the main ecological gradients. We have used this model to measure the importance of the changes induced on landscape by a range of management practices differing in intensity. To achieve this aim we compare the displacement of 116 releves along the ecological gradients between 1983 and 1988. The changes occurring both in bird composition and landscape structure reveal the ecological impacts of the different management practices (hedgerow removal, drainage, ploughing, decreasing grazing pressure). We examine the behaviour of ecological diversity of landscape units differing in structure and use.

AB  - Abstract: In many countries buffer strips have become an important management tool widely accepted for controlling the diffuse pollution and supporting the development of more sustainable agriculture. However, there is the need to investigate their role in intensive farming systems where a realistic and shareable proposal to realize buffer strips can only foresee the use of a limited space. We evaluated the nitrogen buffering capacities of two narrow riparian strips (5–8m) along irrigation ditches located in a typical flat agricultural watershed of the alluvial plain of the River Po (Northern Italy). Subsurface water level and nutrient concentrations were monitored along transects of piezometers installed from crop fields to ditches in two different areas. Spatial and temporal variation in water chemistry and hydrology were investigated to individuate the main processes (biological or physical) leading to groundwater nitrate depletion related to fertilization, pluviometric regime and seasonal variation. The results obtained indicate an elevated nitrate removal efficiency in both riparian areas. Compared to the high mean concentrations measured at the exit of the crop fields (10–90mgl−1 N-NO3−), nitrate levels within riparian sites can be very low, completely disappearing below the ditches. The patterns of some chemical species (O2, SO42− and HCO3−) and the potential denitrification rates suggest that denitrification plays a predominant role in the N-NO3− depletion observed in the first few meters of the herbaceous strip. The key factors in the system are the elevated groundwater residence time and the effect of the evapotranspiration. The water uptake by woody vegetation affects the subsurface water to flow through the riparian zone and, at the same time, it contributes to completely remove the nitrate from the groundwater. Our findings also suggest the double role of riparian vegetation both in ecohydrological and biological terms. In fact the water uptake by trees affects the subsurface flow pattern and contributes to completely remove the nitrate in the riparian zone.

AB  - The effects of broad spectrum and selective insecticides on rove beetles (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) were compared in apple orchards and wheat fields from Hungary. The most common species in orchards were: Omalium caesum, Dexiogyia corticina, Mocyta orbata, Coprochara bipustulata, Sphenoma abdominale, Drusilla canaliculata, Styloxys insecatus, Palporus nitidulus, Heterothops dissimilis, Mocyta fungi, Pella limbata, Pycnota vicina and Hemitropia sordida. The number of species was high in control plots without any insecticide application and less in integrated pest management plots, where selective insecticides were used. In the wheat fields a total of 798 individuals belonging to 20 species were collected. The most widely occurring species were: Staphylinus caesareus, Tachyporus hypnorum, Philonthus cognatus, Aloconota gregaria, Tachyporus chrysomelinus and T. obtusus. Although species from Tachyporus spp. were dominant in cumulative samples, the activity density decreased considerably for the second half of the vegetation period. The fields' structure and the treatments have a significant role in forming the dominance of species. Also the dynamics of each species is highly influenced by the disturbances. These could be explained with different microclimatic and humidity tolerance of the species. The greater mobility of staphylinids may enable them to avoid pesticide treatments in individual fields. These factors (natural weed cower, the presence of the hedgerows and the flying ability of the species) can interact and offer optimal possibilities for predation in agricultural fields.

AB  - To understand how habitat management influences agricultural production, the present study investigated whether the vicinity of mixed (six annual herbaceous species) or monospecific (Diplotaxis tenuifolia) floral margins can improve seed production in coriander. Potted coriander plants under field conditions were used to test: (i) the contribution of insect pollination (open versus bagged umbels) to coriander seed production and (ii) the contribution of floral margins (mixed or monospecific) to pollinator visitation to coriander. Although coriander showed the capacity to self-pollinate, bagged umbels (no insect pollination) produced significantly less seeds than open-pollinated coriander umbels. In the vicinity of floral margins (mixed or monospecific), coriander plants were more frequently visited by pollinators than control plants (no margins), which consequently improved seed production and quality (seed weight and germination rate). Finally, the present study showed that the presence of both mixed and monospecific margins can improve the production of coriander seeds by more than 220% and, in addition, conserve local pollinators within agro-ecosystems.

AB  - - We studied the nutritional and reproductive response of Poecilus cupreus (synonymous with Pterostichus cupreus), one of the most abundant carabid beetles in arable land, to the succession in sixteen 1- to 4-year-old wildflower areas. A total of 390 male and 373 female beetles was examined. Each female was dissected and the number of ripe eggs counted. The nutritional state was expressed by a condition factor, which was calculated for each individual based on the observed weight and elytra length of male and female P. cupreus. Carabids in the 1-year-old wildflower areas contained significantly less ripe eggs than those from the 4-year-old areas. The condition factor of female and male beetles was significantly lower in 1- than 2- to 4-year-old areas. We examined the influence of habitat parameters (vegetation cover, soil water content, coarse and fine sand, pore volume, habitat size and age, surrounding landscape structure) on the reproductive success and nutritional state of P. cupreus in the 16 wildflower areas. The number of eggs was best explained by habitat age, accounting for 53.4% of the variability. The variation in the condition factor of female and male beetles was best explained by habitat age, which accounted for 73% and 71% of the variation, respectively. Moreover, the beetles' reproductive potential and nutritional condition were significantly associated with vegetation cover, and occasionally also with soil water content. The potential of wildflower areas as a reservoir for the generalist predator P. cupreus was shown to increase with successional age.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of farming management (field and boundary management), boundary structure (width and habitat assemblage), and landscape heterogeneity on plant species composition in field boundaries. Plant species were characterised according to their conservation value, life form and affinity to soil nutrient conditions. We surveyed 30 field boundaries next to organic fields and 30 next to conventional fields distributed along a gradient of landscape complexity. A Detrended Correspondence Analysis was performed using all 517 species recorded in order to study the variation in species composition. Field and boundary management, boundary width, habitat assemblage of field boundaries (estimated with the percentage cover of Mediterranean grasslands) and landscape heterogeneity contributed significantly in predicting the variation in species composition. Perennial species of conservation value with affinity to nutrient-poor soil conditions were more likely to be found in wide managed boundaries characterized by a high percentage cover of Mediterranean grasslands, which are adjacent to organic fields and within heterogeneous landscapes.

AB  - Field boundaries are expected to support the maintenance of biodiversity in agroecosystems, since they provide the habitat for a range of plant species. However, plant diversity in field boundaries has decreased substantially in recent decades. This pattern is generally linked with the intensification of agricultural land use at field and landscape level. Therefore, we aimed to test the effect of farming management (field and boundary management), boundary structure (width and habitat assemblage considering the Mediterranean grassland element), and landscape heterogeneity on plant species richness of field boundaries. Plants were recorded along 30 field boundaries next to organic fields and 30 next to conventional fields located in 15 agrarian localities of NE Iberian Peninsula along a gradient of landscape complexity. A total of 517 plant species were identified in the 60 field boundaries. We recorded 162 species (31%) catalogued as rare, very rare or extremely rare in the flora of the Catalan Countries. Our results showed the importance of landscape heterogeneity, field management and habitat assemblage, since they were found to be the most influential variables for plant species richness; whereas boundary width and boundary management were seen to contribute less to explaining plant diversity. Accordingly, agri-environmental schemes should be designed to promote organic farming and maintain the structure of the landscape mosaic in order to benefit plant diversity in field boundaries in the Mediterranean region.

AB  - Hedges provide important nesting, feeding and sheltering sites for birds in agricultural areas, while organic farming also enhances farmland birds. However, it is little known how the interaction of these local variables (amount of hedges and organic management) with landscape scale variables affects birds. We selected paired conventional and organic winter wheat fields and meadows in each of 10 landscapes in Germany. Birds were surveyed in the fields and in the adjoining hedges. More bird species occurred in organic than in conventional fields regardless of land-use type (wheat fields and meadows). However, hedge length had a much stronger effect on bird richness than organic farmland management. We found an interaction of landscape complexity and hedge length in that hedge length enhanced bird richness only in case of simple landscapes (<17% semi-natural areas within a 500 m radius around the centre of bird survey plots). In more complex landscapes the local effect of hedge length levelled off because bird richness was high even without local hedges. Therefore, adding hedges or introducing organic farming practices should be primarily promoted in simple landscapes, where it really makes a difference for biodiversity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Organic farming is a whole-farm management approach believed to encourage biodiversity by excluding the input of agrochemicals and introducing specific management regimes for non-crop habitats. We examined the impact of the hedgerow management regime encouraged for organic farms on small mammal populations, since small mammal numbers influence a range of species at higher trophic levels and, in particular, are key to the conservation of a range of mammalian and avian predators. We compared differences in management and structure of non-crop habitats at the farm-scale between organic and conventional farms, and used within-farm variations in hedgerow size to predict the effect of hedgerow size on small mammals on both farm types. There were no significant differences in the proportion of non-crop habitats between organic and conventional farms, although management differences produced larger hedgerows on organic farms and greater diversity of hedgerow growth stages. However, a difference in hedgerow size between the farm types did not have a significant effect on small mammal abundance or diversity. We conclude that increased hedgerow size is not benefiting small mammal populations on organic farms: significant gains in small mammal numbers may be more effectively achieved by increasing the area of non-crop habitats rather than by improving management regimes.

AB  - The ability of the aphid pathogenic fungus Pandora neoaphidis to remain active in the absence of a resting stage through a combination of continuous infection and as conidia deposited on soil was assessed alongside the potential for planted field margins to act as a refuge for the fungus. P. neoaphidis was able to infect the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, when maintained under controlled conditions that simulated those that occur seasonally in the UK. Although there was a significant inverse relationship between temperature and time-to-kill, with death occurring after 4.2, 6.9 and 13.6 days when maintained under fluctuating summer, autumn and winter temperatures, respectively, there were no additional statistically significant effects of photoperiod. The activity of inoculum on soil was indirectly assessed by baiting with A. pisum. Under controlled conditions P. neoaphidis remained active on soil and was able to infect aphids for up to 80 days. However, the percentage of aphids that became infected decreased from 76% on day 1 to 11% on day 80. Whereas there was little difference in the activity of conidia that had been maintained at 4 degrees C and 10 degrees C, activity at 18 degrees C was considerably reduced. Under field conditions the activity of inoculum was strongly influenced by season. On day 49 there was little or no activity during spring, summer or winter. However, during autumn a mean proportion of 0.08 aphids still became infected with P. neoaphidis. Margin type did not affect the activity of conidia nor was there a difference in activity between blocks that had regenerated naturally and those that had been planted. These results suggest that P. neoaphidis can infect aphids and remain active on soil under the abiotic conditions that occur seasonally in the UK and that this fungus may be able to persist annually without a resting stage.

AB  - Enteric microbial pathogens originating from agricultural practices pose a serious threat to surface water quality and human health. A two-phase study was conducted in southern Illinois that examined the ability of various riparian buffer species to attenuate fecal coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli (E. coli) in overland flow, while also assessing E. coli persistence in associated buffer soils. Plots established with giant cane (Arundinaria gigantea (Walt.) Muhl.), Kentucky Bluegrass (Poa pratensis), Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), and non-vegetated control buffers were subjected to artificial flooding with cattle (Bos taurus) manure-laden water. Mean bacteria concentrations in overland flow exiting all plots were significantly higher than concentrations found in the source slurry. To assess E. coli persistence in plots, overland flow was collected from a simulated rainfall event 4 days following slurry application, and from natural rainfall events 22, 46, 94, 97, and 111 days after the application. Overland flow exiting all plots (including non-vegetated controls) exhibited mean E. coli concentrations significantly higher than those found in the initial slurry applied. The observed concentrations may have been the result of overland flow characteristics and high levels of ambient fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) present with plots. The moist, shaded conditions created by plot vegetation may have produced prime habitat to harbor FIB. Vegetated buffer strips (VBS) may have been effective at attenuating FIB, however, performance may have been masked by the exceptionally high ambient FIB populations that were present in adjacent soils. The young age of the VBS (< 1 year) may have also influenced their seemingly poor FIB attenuation. As the VBS age, increases in above and below ground vegetative material may act to increase VBS attenuation capabilities.

AB  - Anthropogenic modification of native woodlands and grasslands in the Great Plains has altered the abundance and distribution of many species of mammals. To study habitat effects on the eastern woodrat (Neotoma fioridana), we surveyed nests of the eastern woodrat in woodlands, grasslands, and croplands along 77 km of secondary roads in three counties in north-central Kansas. All nests were located in woodlands (<2% of habitat), although grasslands and croplands constituted 36% and 62% of habitat surveyed, respectively. In our survey, nests were associated positively with shelterbelts (3.6 nests per 100 m of road edge) but not with shrub patches (1.1 nests per 100 m of road edge) or riparian woodlands (0.3 nests per 100 m of road edge). Consequently, we specifically censused nests in an additional 12 riparian woodlands and 12 shelterbelts. Nests of eastern Woodrats were less dense in riparian woodlands (9.4 nests/ha) than in shelterbelts (55.5 nests/ha). Density of woodrat nests decreased as width of a wooded area increased. Further, nests per 100 m of length of woodland did not increase as the width of woodland increased. These patterns suggest that woodland edge, not woodland interior, is the primary factor in abundance of eastern woodrats in this region. Although the eastern woodrat has previously been considered a woodland species, our results suggest that this assessment is incorrect. Our observations demonstrate that anthropogenic modification of the Great Plains, in the form of planted shelterbelts and expanded riparian woodland, likely has increased the distribution and abundance of eastern woodrats, compared to the mid-1800s.

AB  - Populations of the linyphiid spider Lepthyphantes tenuis were sampled in field margins in May, July and September in 1990–1991 and 1995–1996. Field margins were subjected to 10 grassland management regimes, which included the effects of spraying the herbicide glyphosate, cutting, leaving vegetation in situ after the cut, sowing and a control. These treatments were randomised within six complete blocks at the University of Oxford’s farm at Wytham. Cutting vegetation had an immediate effect on number of L. tenuis in both spring and summer. Cutting margins in summer had a more persistent effect on populations of L. tenuis than did cutting margins in spring. The effect of cutting was not mitigated by leaving cut vegetation in situ, but no cutting ensured higher number of L. tenuis in margins, an indication that height and structural complexity of grassland vegetation were important in determining population size. Significantly fewer spiders were found in July and September plots which had been sprayed with herbicide in late June/early July. However, spider numbers were not affected by glyphosate application when samples were taken nearly a year later. Sowing a wildflower seed mixture had no significant effects on number of this generalist predator although other invertebrate groups did benefit. Field margins provided an excellent source habitat for L. tenuis. Habitats that border crop fields acted as a refugia for many other beneficial invertebrates and should be retained as an important component of the agricultural landscape.

AB  - Trials during two consecutive soybean cycles were performed in central Santa Fe in order to determine the main spider families present in the crop and to determine the influence of spontaneous margin flora on colonization towards the lot. Samplings were done by sweeping net and pitfall traps. It was concluded that: 1. Oxyopidae was the most frequent family in the herbaceous layer of both the margins and the soybean crop, and Lycosidae in the lower layer; 2. Margin strips in a soybean lot contribute to the colonization of the crop by spiders of aerial habits and also promote re-colonization following pesticide applications, since they act as shelters. The influence on spiders of terrestrial habits was somewhat lower; 3. The distribution of the populations of spiders of terrestrial habits was homogeneous in a soybean crop seeded directly and these predators had a greater capacity to control pests at all points of the lot.

AB  - The suitability of both arable field margins and beetle banks as nesting habitat for the harvest mouse Micromys minutus was investigated. The proportion of robust stemmed herbaceous plants and grasses at nest sites in beetle banks was greater relative to the comparison sites. The main nest supporting species in field margins were bramble Rubus fruticosus and thorns Crataegus monogyna and Prunus spinosa. Nests were constructed where the vertical structure of the vegetation was significantly denser than average. Nest density was greater in the beetle banks than in field margins. The creation of beetle banks and grassy field margins on arable farmland clearly provided suitable nesting sites for harvest mice. The current management practices seemed to provide the structural vegetation necessary for nesting harvest mice. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study was performed to characterise in-stream pesticide exposure within the Palatinate vineyard region in south-west Germany, evaluate the influence of buffer strip widths and identify mitigation measures for the relevant entry pathways. In-stream water and sediment samples that were taken at nine sampling sites of different buffer widths following intense rainfall, and edge-of-field runoff that were sampled in erosion tills were analysed regarding 28 active ingredients of pesticides including copper. In-stream samples contained a mix of 8 +/- 4 pesticide compounds, resulting in total pesticide concentrations of 1.4-8.9 mu g l(-1) for water and 16-670 mu g kg(-1) dw for sediment. Following an exceptional rainfall event with a previous 34-day drought period, pesticide concentrations reached 7.0-83.4 mu g l(-1). Fungicides were the most important pesticides found and were significantly correlated with the pesticide application frequency and rate. The calculated toxicity values per sample (TUmax) indicated that both organic pesticides and copper concentrations likely cause ecotoxicological effects in the field. The buffer strip width was of little importance for pesticide in-stream concentrations because pesticide entry occurred mainly via the field path network and erosion rills. Pesticide in-stream concentrations were significantly and positively correlated with the concentrations detected in erosion rills (R-2 = 0.56). As possible risk mitigation measures, we suggest the implementation of grassed field paths and vegetated ditches or wetlands. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The European Union's directive for sustainable use of pesticides requires implementing risk mitigation measures at streams threatened by pesticide entries. The need for mitigation measures was investigated at 10 stream sites within an intensively used arable region in central Germany by characterizing pesticide exposure following edge-of-field runoff and effects on the aquatic macroinvertebrates. Moreover, the influence of riparian buffer strip width (as a mitigation measure) at the sampling sites was considered. Generally, invertebrate fauna was dominated by pesticide-tolerant species, suggesting a high pesticide exposure at almost all sites. This result is also reflected by the elevated levels of suspended particle contamination in terms of toxic units (logTUMax>2), corresponding to one-hundredth of the median lethal concentration (LC50) to Daphnia magna. At two sites that received high aqueous-phase entries of the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin (logTUMax>0.6), the abundance and number of sensitive species in terms of the species at risk index decreased during the pesticide application period. In contrast, no acute significant negative effects on macroinvertebrates were observed at sites characterised by low water-phase toxicity (logTUMax<3.5). An influence of riparian buffer strip width on pesticide exposure was not observed, supposedly because of the presence of erosion rills and ephemeral ditches. In conclusion, results show that mitigation measures (such as the improvement of currently present riparian buffer strips) are needed in the study area. Environ Toxicol Chem 2013;32:12541263.

AB  - In response to concern about the loss of ecosystem services once provided by natural riparian systems, state and federal agencies have established incentive programs for landowners to convert sensitive lands from agricultural to conservation uses. Enhancement of wildlife habitat, while identified as a function of such systems, has often been of secondary importance to soil conservation and water quality objectives. Though greatly important, little consideration has been given to how specific species will respond to the design and management of riparian buffers or other conservation lands. This study compared avian communities within a chronosequence of riparian buffers established on previously cropped or pastured land with those of the nearby matrix land cover types (row crop fields and an intensively grazed pasture). The riparian buffers consisted of native grasses, forbs, and woody vegetation established at three different times (2, 9, and 14+ years prior to survey). At each site, 10 min point counts for breeding birds were conducted using 50 m fixed radius plots, which were visited eight times between May 15 and July 10, 2008. A total of 54 bird species were observed over all of the study sites. The re-established riparian buffers in this study had higher bird abundance, richness, and diversity than the crop and pasture sites. These results suggest that re-establishing native riparian vegetation in areas of intensive agriculture will provide habitat for a broad suite of bird species, but that specific species will reflect successional stage, horizontal and vertical vegetative structure, and compositional diversity of the buffer vegetation. These results emphasize the importance of matching buffer design and management to species requirements if the objectives are to attract specific target species or species groups.

AB  - Riparian areas are transitional zones between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The riparian areas investigated in this thesis are transitions between row-cropped uplands and lower order streams. Riparian areas can serve many functions such as filtering pollutants from overland flow, stabilizing stream bank, storing surface water and sediment, and maintaining biodiversity by providing wildlife habitat. In response to concern about the loss of ecosystem services once provided by natural riparian systems, state and federal agencies have established incentive programs for landowners to convert sensitive lands from agricultural to conservation uses. Soil conservation and water quality are two important riparian functions that were investigated in the first study which measured stream bank erosion. This study was conducted in NE Missouri on stream reaches with different riparian land use/vegetation. The second study focused on the enhancement of wildlife habitat in riparian areas. It compared avian communities within a chronosequence of riparian buffers established on previously cropped or pastured land with those of the nearby matrix land cover types (row crop fields and an intensively grazed pasture). The results of the bird survey support the establishment of designed riparian buffers including trees, shrubs, and/or grass to increase habitat for many bird species in highly modified landscapes such as the agriculturally dominated Midwest. However, the results of the stream bank erosion study did not show that natural perennial vegetation (trees and shrubs) was reducing stream bank erosion in northeast Missouri. Riparian areas are complex and much more research is needed to understand how to utilize and improve their natural functions.

AB  - The Tarland Catchment Initiative is a partnership venture between researchers, land managers, regulators, and the local community. Its aims are to improve water quality, promote biodiversity, and increase awareness of catchment management. In this study, the effects of buffer strip installations and remediation of a large septic tank effluent were appraised by water physico-chemistry (suspended solids, NO, NH, soluble reactive P) and stream macroinvertebrate indices used by the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency. It was done during before and after interventions over an 8-yr period using a paired catchment approach. Because macroinvertebrate indices were previously shown to respond negatively to suspended solid concentrations in the study area, the installation of buffer strips along the headwaters was expected to improve macroinvertebrate scores. Although water quality (soluble reactive P, NH) improved downstream of the septic tank effluent after remediation, there was no detectable change in macroinvertebrate scores. Buffer strip installations in the headwaters had no measurable effects (beyond possible weak trends) on water quality or macroinvertebrate scores. Either the buffer strips have so far been ineffective or ineffectiveness of assessment methods and sampling frequency and time lags in recovery prevent us detecting reliable effects. To explain and appreciate these constraints on measuring stream recovery, continuous capacity building with land managers and other stakeholders is essential; otherwise, the feasibility of undertaking sufficient management interventions is likely to be compromised and projects deemed unsuccessful.

AB  - Grassed waterways have been used for decades to prevent soil erosion inagricultural cropland, but their benefits to wildlife had not been evaluated prior to our study. We documented bird species composition and relative abundance during the breeding seasonin 44 grassed waterways in central Iowa. The waterways were planted predominately tosmooth brome (Bromus inermis) and were in cornfields and soybean fields. Forty-eight birdspecies were observed in waterways, compared with only 14 in the surrounding crop fields. Red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), dickcissels (Spiza americana), barn swallows (Hirundo rustica), western meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta), brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and song sparrows (Melospizamelodia) were the most abundant bird species in the grassed waterways. Total bird abundancein the grassed waterways averaged 2198 birds observed/census/100 ha compared with 682 in crop fields. Temporal patterns in bird abundance were attributed primarily to aspects of the waterways and surrounding cropland that changed over time, such as vegetation height.Because most (53%) of the bird species were at peak abundance in the waterways during 4-22 July, grassed waterways should not be mowed until the end of August or earlySeptember.

AB  - The production-oriented agricultural system of Midwestern United States has caused environmental problems such as soil degradation and nonpoint source (NPS) pollution of water. Riparian buffers have been shown to reduce the impacts of NPS pollutants on stream water quality through the enhancement of riparian zone soil quality. The objective of this study was to compare soil-water infiltration in a Coland soil (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Endoaquoll) under multi-species riparian buffer vegetation with that of cultivated fields and a grazed pasture. Eight infiltration measurements were made, in each of six treatments. Bulk density, antecedent soil moisture, and particle size were also examined. The average 60-min cumulative infiltration was five times greater under the buffers than under the cultivated field and pasture. Cumulative infiltration in the multi-species riparian buffer was in the order of silver maple > grass filter > switchgrass. Cumulative infiltration did not differ significantly (P < 0.05) among corn and soybean crop fields and the pasture. Soil bulk densities under the multi-species buffer vegetation were significantly (P < 0.05) smaller than in the crop fields and the pasture. Other measured parameters did not show consistent trends. Thus, when using infiltration as an index, the established multi-species buffer vegetation seemed to improve soil quality after six years.

AB  - Flowering plants have been shown to differ with regard to their attractiveness to parasitoids and nectar accessibility. These floral traits are likely to affect the foraging performance of parasitoids in agricultural landscapes. Using a spatially explicit simulation model we explore how the attractiveness and nectar availability of flowering field margins affects their impact on parasitoids and ultimately on pest populations in crops. The model simulates the movement, nectar feeding and parasitism of parasitoids in an agroecosystem composed of a crop and adjacent flower margin. The perception of olfactory cues emitted by flowers and host-infestcd plants drives the movement of the parasitoid. Its preference for floral nectar or hosts is described as a function of its internal energy status. Model validation reveals that simulations and measurements of the spatial distribution and energy status of parasitoids are generally in good agreement. Model simulations suggest that aggregation of parasitoids at flower strips are caused by a prolonged longevity of parasitoids feeding on floral nectar as well as by attraction of parasitoids from the surrounding area. We found no indication for depletion of parasitoids in the field interior as a result of migration towards flower strips. Simulations further suggest that the attractiveness of flowers is an important characteristic that should be taken into account for the selection of flowering plants. This study implies that tailoring nectar supply to the requirements of parasitoids holds potential to increase their effectiveness as biological control agents. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A field study was conducted to determine the effect of length of grass buffer zones in reducing pollutant concentration in rainfall runoff from land application areas. Evaluation of pollutant concentrations in runoff at various distances downslope from an area where caged-layer poultry manure was applied regularly indicated that for the conditions of this experiment a buffer area length to waste area length ratio of 1.0 was usually re-quired to reduce concentrations to those measured in runoff from a similar plot receiving no manure. Less buf-fer area would be needed if concentrations greater than background conditions were acceptable.

AB  - It is not known if grassy margins contribute to the conservation of biodiversity if situated along organically managed cereal fields as the contrast in environmental conditions between fields and margins may be too small in absence of pesticide applications. Communities of spiders, ground beetles, true bugs and aphids were sampled in 2years along transects from the centre of organically managed cereal fields into adjacent grassy margins. Based on species richness, abundances, ecological and body size traits of species and taxonomic distinctness between species, communities were compared between organically managed cereal fields and their grassy margins. The species richness, abundance and variation in taxonomic distinctness of true bugs were significantly higher in grassy margins. For spiders and ground beetles, these metrics were either higher in cereal fields or did not differ significantly. At the species level, spiders living under stones or in soil crevices, as well as phytophagous ground beetles and true bugs that overwinter as eggs benefited from grassy margins. True bug communities in cereal fields were dominated by a few abundant species, whereas communities in margins were rather dominated by a few large species. Our comprehensive analyses highlight the importance of accounting for species identities and biology in biodiversity studies. The traits that characterised arthropod species that benefited from margins are not characteristic for pest species. Grassy margins along organic fields therefore represent an important agri-environmental scheme for the conservation of several arthropod taxa and margins should not be removed to increase the crop production area in organically managed cereal fields.

AB  - The diet and foraging behaviour of a population of Dunnocks inhabiting hedgerows was studied between November 1981 and December 1983 at Nedge Hill, Shropshire. Invertebrates were most abundant in hedgerows and adjacent vegetation during the summer when the diet of the Dunnock was largely insectivorous. Beetles (Coleoptera) were the main taxa in the diet, with weevils (Curculionidae) and rove beetles (Staphylinidae) predominating. Arachnids were important, and snails (Gastropoda), earthworms (Oligochaeta), springtails (Collembola) and flies (Diptera) were taken. Seeds are available in the study area from July and featured in the diet from August to April. Nettle Urtica dioica comprised the main seed in the diet. Other important seeds included Yorkshire fog Holcus lanatus, elder Sambucus nigra and dock Rumex obtusifolius. Stomach stones were most common in the faeces in winter. The Dunnocks were predominantly ground feeders and mainly used a hop-picking technique. Some seeds and invertebrates were picked directly off plants by Dunnocks above the ground. Most feeding occurred in hedgerows, which formed a small proportion of the study area. Overgrown hedgerows were the most important of the five hedgerow types. Nettle patches were an important feeding habitat. Dunnocks usually foraged alone or in pairs and rarely fed in association with other birds. The highest proportion of time spent feeding was in January and the lowest in May.

AB  - The carbon content of microbial biomass and the kinetic characteristics of microbial respiration response to substrate addition have been estimated for hernozem soils under different land use: arable lands used for 10, 46, and 76 years, mowed meadow, natural forest, and forest shelter belt. Microbial biomass and the content of microbial carbon in humus (C-mic,/C-org,) decreased in the following order: soils under forest cenoses-mowed meadow-10-year arable land-46- and 75-year arable land. The amount of microbial carbon in the long-plowed horizon was 40% of its content in the upper horizon of natural forest. Arable soils were characterized by a lower metabolic diversity of microbial community and by the highest portion of microorganisms able to grow directly on glucose introduced into soil. The effects of different scenarios of carbon sequestration in soil on the amounts and activity of microbial biomass are discussed.

AB  - Agricultural intensification, including changes in cutting, grazing and fertilizer regimes, has led to declines in UK and NW European grassland biodiversity. We aimed to develop field margin management practices that would support invertebrate diversity and abundance on intensively managed grassland farms, focusing on planthoppers and leafhoppers (Auchenorrhyncha). Replicated across four farms in south-west England, we manipulated conventional management practices (inorganic fertilizer, cutting frequency and height, and aftermath grazing) to create seven treatments along a gradient of decreasing management intensity and increasing sward architectural complexity. Auchenorrhyncha were sampled annually between 2003 and 2005. Auchenorrhyncha abundance and species richness was highest in the most extensively managed treatments. Abundance was lowest with frequent cutting, while species richness was lowest where cattle grazing occurred. Unexpectedly, application of inorganic fertilizer had no effect on Auchenorrhyncha abundance or species richness. Management options that enhance invertebrate diversity, while allowing the remainder of the field to be managed conventionally, represent a potentially important conservation tool for many lowland improved grasslands. Extensification of conventional management in field margin areas of such grasslands are likely to benefit this numerically dominant component of grassland invertebrate fauna. These management practices have the potential to be incorporated into existing UK and European agri-environment schemes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - There are approximately 29,000 ha of grass buffer strips in the UK under Agri-Environment Schemes; however, typically they are floristically poor and as such are of limited biodiversity value. Introducing a sown wildflower component has the potential to increase dramatically the value of these buffer strips for a suite of native species, including butterflies. This study investigates management practices aiming to promote the establishment and maintenance of wildflowers in existing buffer strips. The effectiveness of two methods used to increase the establishment of wildflowers for the benefit of native butterfly species were tested, both individually and in combination. The management practices were: (1) the application of a selective graminicide (fluazifop-P-butyl) which reduces the dominance of competitive grasses; and (2) scarification of the soil which creates germination niches for sown wildflower seeds. A wildflower seed mix consisting of nine species was sown in conjunction with the scarification treatment. Responses of wildflowers and butterflies were monitored for two years after establishment. Results indicate that the combined scarification and graminicide treatment produced the greatest cover and species richness of sown wildflowers. Butterfly abundance, species richness and diversity were positively correlated with sown wildflower species richness, with the highest values in the combined scarification and graminicide treatment. These findings have confirmed the importance of both scarification as a means of introducing wildflower seed into existing buffer strips, and subsequent management using graminicides, for the benefit of butterflies. Application of this approach could provide tools to help butterfly conservation on farmland in the future.

AB  - Grass buffer strips have been widely sown to mitigate against intensive agricultural management practices that have negatively impacted on invertebrate and plant biodiversity in arable farming systems. Typically, such strips are floristically species poor and are dominated by grasses. In the present study, we developed management practices to enhance the floristic and structural diversity of these existing strips for the benefit of spiders, a key provider of natural pest control in crops., Across three UK arable farms, we investigated the benefits of: (i) scarification to create germination niches into which wildflower seeds were sown and (ii) the effect of graminicide applications to suppress grass dominance. Spiders were sampled twice per year (July and September) during 2008 and 2009., The combination of scarification with wildflower seeds, as well as graminicide, resulted in the greatest wildflower cover and lowest grass cover, with a general trend of increased abundance of adult and juvenile spiders. The abundance of Pachygnatha degeeri, Bathyphantes gracilis and juvenile wolf spiders of the genus Pardosa was positively correlated with wildflower cover, probably reflecting increased prey availability. Sward structure was negatively correlated with Erigone atra, Oedothorax fuscus and juvenile Pardosa abundance., Management that utilizes existing commonly adopted agri-environment options, such as grass buffer strips, represents a potentially important conservation tool for increasing the quantity and quality of invertebrate habitats. This can maximize opportunities for the provision of multiple ecosystem services, including pest regulation by predators such as spiders. These management practices have the potential to be incorporated into existing U.K. and European agri-environment schemes.

AB  - Addition of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) barriers to vegetative filter strips (FS) shows potential as conservation practice. This study evaluates the comparative effectiveness of three conservation practices in reducing runoff, sediment, N, and P losses from 1.5- by 16-m plots on an Aeric Epiaqualf. Three practices compared are a traditional fescue (Festuca arundinacea) filter strip (Fescue-FS), a switchgrass barrier in combination with the Fescue-FS (B-Fescue-FS) and a switchgrass barrier in combination with a native grass and forbs species filter strip (B-Native-FS). This study also predicts transport of sediment, N, and P in Fescue-FS and B-Fescue-FS. Fescue-FS and B-Fescue-FS of equal widths (0.7 m) significantly reduced runoff and sediment transport as compared with a continuous cultivated fallow (CCF) treatment, but B-Fescue-FS was more effective for reducing runoff (p < 0.05) and sediment (p < 0.01) transport. B-Fescue-FS was also more effective than Fescue-FS for reducing losses of organic N, NO3-N, NH4-N, particulate P, and PO4-P (p < 0.01). Fescue-FS and B-Native-FS were equally effective for reducing runoff, sediment, and nutrient loss. Effectiveness of FS increased with distance with 18% of runoff, 92% of sediment, and 71% of nutrient leaving the source area being reduced in the first 4 m of the FS. An equation to predict sediment associated with runoff ponding above barriers explained approximately 70% of the variability between measured and predicted values of sediment, organic N, and particulate P transport. Combination of switchgrass barriers with FS is an effective alternative to Fescue-FS alone for reducing sediment and nutrients in runoff.

AB  - The benefits of grass barriers or hedges for reducing offsite transport of non-point-source water pollutants from croplands are well recognized, but their ancillary benefits on soil properties have received less attention. We studied the 15-yr cumulative effects of narrow and perennial switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) barriers on soil organic C (SOC), total N, particulate organic matter (POM), and associated soil structural properties as compared with the cropped area on an Aksarben silty clay loam (fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Argiudoll) with 5.4% slope in eastern Nebraska. Five switchgrass barriers were established in 1998 at similar to 38-m intervals parallel to the crop rows in a field under a conventional tillage and no-till grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]-corn (Zea mays L.) rotation. Compared with the cropped area, switchgrass barriers accumulated about 0.85 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) of SOC and 80 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) of total soil N at the 0 to 15 cm soil depth. Switchgrass barriers also increased coarse POM by 60%. Mean weight diameter of water-stable aggregates increased by 70% at 0 to 15 cm and by 40% at 15 to 60 cm, indicating that switchgrass barriers improved soil aggregation at deeper depths. Large (4.75-8 mm) macroaggregates under switchgrass barriers contained 30% more SOC than those under the cropped area. Switchgrass-induced changes in SOC concentration were positively associated with aggregate stability (r = 0.89***) and porosity (r = 0.47*). Overall, switchgrass barriers integrated with intensively managed agroecosystems can increase the SOC pool and improve soil structural properties.

AB  - Filter strips are strips of herbaceous vegetation planted along agricultural field margins adjacent to streams or wetlands and are designed to intercept sediment, nutrients, and agrichemicals. Roughly 16,000 ha of filter strips have been established in Maryland through the United States Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program. Filter strips often represent the only uncultivated herbaceous areas on farmland in Maryland and therefore may be important habitat for early-successional bird species. Most filter strips in Maryland are planted to either native warm-season grasses or cool-season grasses and range in width from 10.7 m to 91.4 m. From 2004 to 2007 we studied the breeding and wintering bird communities in filter strips adjacent to wooded edges and non-buffered field edges and the effect that grass type and width of filter strips had on bird community composition. We used 5 bird community metrics (total bird density, species richness, scrub-shrub bird density, grassland bird density, and total avian conservation value), species-specific densities, nest densities, and nest survival estimates to assess the habitat value of filter strips for birds. Breeding and wintering bird community metrics were greater in filter strips than in non-buffered field edges but did not differ between cool-season and warm-season grass filter strips. Most breeding bird community metrics were negatively related to the percent cover of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata) in >= 1 yr. Breeding bird density was greater in narrow (<30 m) compared to wide (>60 m) filter strips. Our results suggest that narrow filter strips adjacent to wooded edges can provide habitat for many bird species but that wide filter strips provide better habitat for grassland birds, particularly obligate grassland species. If bird conservation is an objective, avoid planting orchardgrass in filter strips and reduce or eliminate orchardgrass from filter strips through management practices. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society

AB  - Census data of a partridge population are analysed, chick mortality is shown to be the dominant population process causing fluctuations in the total annual mortality and hence the young to old ratio in Sept. Chick mortality and overwintering loss (mainly shooting) act in a density dependent manner. Other mortality factors, e.g. nesting success, were not density related nor were they significantly related to variations in total mortality. Nest density in the spring, which is an expression of the population level of a habitat is shown to be related to the conditions of the field boundary: incomplete hedges and grass tracks being favored. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors

AB  - Forest and grass riparian buffers are a common conservation practice to control nonpoint source pollution. In the lower midwestern United States, there is significant interest in incorporating a once common native riparian species, giant cane (Arundinaria gigantea) in riparian restoration designs. Thus, assessing the water quality benefits of giant cane buffers is warranted. Ground water nitrate and ammonium concentrations were measured at the field edge (0 m), and 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, 9.0, and 12.0 m from the field edge through giant cane and forest riparian buffers adjacent to agricultural fields along three streams in southern Illinois. Ground water nitrate and ammonium were not different between the giant cane and forest riparian buffers, nor were there significant reductions in these nutrients through the riparian zones when all three sites were considered. However, site-specific regressions of nutrient concentration vs. distance showed significant reductions (>80%) in nitrate through two forest and one cane riparian buffers, and a significant reduction in ammonium (95%) through a cane buffer. Our results indicate that buffer effectiveness may be dependent on landscape position and water table depth.

AB  - Forest and grass riparian buffers have been shown to be effective best management practices for controlling nonpoint source pollution. However, little research has been conducted on giant cane (Arundinaria gigantea (Walt. Muhl.)], a formerly common bamboo species, native to the lower midwestern and southeastern United States, and its ability to reduce nutrient loads to streams. From May 2002 through May 2003, orthophosphate or dissolved reactive phosphate (DRP) concentrations in ground water were measured at successive distances from the field edge through 12 m of riparian buffers of both giant cane and mixed hardwood forest along three streams draining agricultural land in the Cache River watershed in southern Illinois. Giant cane and mixed hardwood forest did not differ in their DRP sequestration abilities. Ground water DRP concentrations were significantly reduced (14 percent) in the first 1.5 m of the buffers, and there was an overall 28 percent reduction in DRP concentration by 12 m from the field edge. The relatively low DRP reductions compared to other studies could be attributed to high DRP input levels, narrow (12 m) buffer lengths, and/or mature (28 to 48 year old) riparian vegetation.

AB  - Restoring plant species richness in intensively farmed areas by means of agri-environment schemes (AES) seems particularly difficult. We studied the effectiveness of a decade of AES in enhancing biodiversity in ditch banks on six modern dairy farms in the Western Peat District in the Netherlands, taking into account the roles of local productivity and of regional diversity and productivity. Biodiversity is characterised as total number of vascular plant species and number of target plant species and productivity as biomass, Ellenberg N-value and grass/forb ratio. We analyzed the repeated AES releves sampled in two periods, 1993-1995 and 2000-2003 and the diversity-productivity relationships in space and over time. For the analysis of the role of the regional factors, repeated AES and reference releves were compared. Number of target species remained stable, whilst the total number of species decreased, and the productivity increased in general in AES ditch banks. We found a clear negative diversity-productivity relationship in space and over time. AES ditch banks showed higher total number of species and comparable to higher number of target species than the reference ditch banks, in general, however, the productivity was also lower in AES ditch banks. The development of AES ditch banks was similar to the regional developments, although differences tended to become smaller in the study period. We hypothesize that the main reason that ditch bank AES do not overall successfully reduce productivity, is because the AES also recommended late mowing and that because of colonization constraints, the region cannot contribute to a positive development. Improvement of AES should, therefore, include adaptation of the mowing regime in high-productivity situations as well as regional strategies to restore the biodiversity of the ditch bank flora.

AB  - Evaporation from 3 tanks was measured daily for 6 months in the summer of 1972. One of the tanks was in an open unsheltered situation, and the other two were at different distances (10h and 20h) from a shelterbelt of deciduous trees. The shelter had no significant effect on the measured evaporation. There was a low positive correlation with wind, and a large and decidedly significant correlation with sunshine hours. © 1974.

AB  - The use of vegetative filter strips (VFSs) in the mitigation of suspended sediment and soluble nutrient loads from agriculturally derived overland flows is a widespread practice. VFSs have been used in a wide variety of situations to treat runoff from croplands, feed lots, dairy operations, confined animal feeding operations, and roadsides, among other locations. While vegetative matter must regularly be removed from vegetative filter strips in an effort to prevent them from becoming nutrient load sources, very limited attempts have been made (with the exception of biofuel harvesting) to harvest that biomass for a useable purpose. This dissertation examines the novel approach of establishing vegetative filter strips on the ends of surface-irrigated, row-cropped fields with commonly utilized forage species for the direct mitigation of suspended sediment and soluble nutrient loads in overland flow while concurrently producing a marketable forage crop. A review of the pertinent literature is provided followed by a detailed overview of the experimental setup. Five commonly utilized forage crops were used to establish vegetative filter strips of varying lengths on the ends of furrow-irrigated, row-cropped fields in an arid environment. Vegetative filter strips of 3.05 (10 ft), 6.07 m (20 ft), and 9.14 m (30 ft) in width were found to have removal efficiencies exceeding 99% for: total inflow volume, total suspended solids, NO 3 -N, NH4 -H, PO4 -P and total P while yielding marketable forage biomass at a rates roughly comparable to average yields from regional hay farms. Statistical analyses on mean removal efficiencies showed a significant statistical difference among the performance of VFS width and vegetation cover type for mean suspended sediment removal efficiencies, and among vegetation cover type for NH4-N mean removal efficiencies. No significant statistical difference was shown among either vegetation cover types or VFS width for mean removal efficiencies of NO 3 -N, PO4 -P or total P. NH4 -N removal among differing VFS lengths was shown not to be statistically different.

AB  - Three field experiments with broadened permanent field boundaries were established in agricultural landscapes near Uppsala (southern Sweden). One aim was to test methods for increasing the amount of non-cultivated areas with high plant species diversity and at the same time suppressing the occurrence of weeds. The treatments consisted of re-establishing or broadening boundary strips, sowing a mixture of ley grasses and clover, of wild meadow species, or planting bushes. All treatments were managed by yearly mowing and taking away of the plant material. The vegetation was examined on two occasions during a 10-year period. At the second occasion, a set of untreated field boundaries (reference boundaries) in the vicinity of each experiment was examined for comparison. Sowing meadow species changed the species composition substantially compared to untreated boundaries. Out of 32 sown species, 22 remained after 10 years. These species are normally found in well-managed meadows or pastures. Species that did not establish or disappeared tended to be either adapted to moist or to dry conditions. Sowing meadow species kept the abundance of weeds on a lower level than sowing clover and grasses or free regeneration at one site and kept weed abundance lower or at least not higher than in reference boundaries.

AB  - Field experiments have been conducted in the semiarid southwest region of La Pampa, Argentina, in order to investigate the effect of different types of windbreak on wind characteristics and growth parameters of wheat (Triticum aestivum, Buck Charrua variety) within the sheltered region. Windbreaks decrease wind speed, reducing damage to the crop and improving yield and quality. Sheltering may improve microclimate conditions for plant growth and protects the soil from wind erosion. Aspects of the sheltering ability of four different windbreaks have been tested: single and double row herbaceous (Tritio secale) shelterbelts, and two different artificial wooden fences, with the same overall average porosity, but with different porosity distributions. Mean velocity, turbulence intensity, skewness distributions and spectral and wavelet analysis have been performed in order to characterise the turbulent flow downstream of the different windbreaks. Wheat grain yield and harvest index were compared with adjacent unsheltered plantations. The single and double row shelterbelts enhanced the grain yield and the harvest index of the protected plants. An influence of the turbulent structure on plant growth is suggested by the different response of plants sheltered by the two types of artificial fences. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the results of an acarological survey started in 1984 in hedges bordering vineyards in Northern Switzerland where natural populations of the economically important predatory mite Typhlordromus pyri occur. The objective of these investigations was to identify those plant species in the hedges and forest margins adjacent to vineyards that carry high populations of this important predator, and to evaluate the potential role of hedges as ecological refuges and sources of T. pyri. We found high and consistent densities of T. pyri on Rubus fruticosus, and less regularly on Cornus sanguinea, Corylus avellana and Lonicera xylosteum. We conclude that hedges can provide ecological refuges and sources of this economically important predatory mite where earlier applications of inappropriate pesticides have eliminated these important antagonists. However, the inoculative release of T. pyri along with the increase of the internal ecological diversity of the vineyard achieved by proper management of the green cover plants ("weed") will have a strong influence on predator densities within the vineyards.

AB  - In Cayuga County, New York, date of silking was the most important predictor of blackbird (primarily Agelaius phoeniceus) damage to Zea mays; earlier maturing fields received greater damage. A field's peak population of northern corn rootworm beetles Diabrotica longicornis, was the next most important variable and was also negatively correlated with bird damage. Other variables of lesser importance were the extent to which a field was bordered by woods and hedgerows and the field's weediness (both positively correlated with damage). Husk extension past the tip of a corn ear was always negatively correlated with blackbird damage within a given field that received higher amounts of bird damage. Because this variable was unimportant in explaining variation in damage among fields, recommending use of corn hybrids whose bird- resistance is based primarily on husk extension is unwarranted.-from Authors

AB  - Shelterbelts are common features of farm landscapes that provide shelter for livestock and crops and timber but may also benefit wildlife. The importance of shelterbelt plant diversity for birds was investigated by a survey of 62 sites in the Central West region of New South Wales, Australia. An area search technique was used to assess bird occurrence. An all subsets and exponential regression analysis approach explored the relationships between woody plant diversity and avifauna diversity (using Hill's diversity index), whilst seasonal variations were analysed using restricted maximum likelihood. Sixty-six bird species, including many that are woodland-dependent, representing eight foraging guilds, were observed in the shelterbelts. More species of birds occurred and at higher density in more floristically diverse shelterbelts. Other factors found to influence avifaunal use of shelterbelts were woody plant density, shelterbelt width, structural complexity, tree height, crown cover index and elevation. Seasonal analysis confirmed the importance of these independent variables but also revealed the significance of shelterbelt's proximity to water during summer for birds using this habitat. This study shows that floristic diversity, amongst other factors, is a significant predictor of avifauna diversity in shelterbelts and suggests that shelterbelts may be designed to optimize their wildlife habitat and biodiversity conservation values.

AB  - The performance of narrow buffer strips, in abating the NO3-N concentrations in the water coming from cropland was tested in an experiment carried out on the low plains of the Veneto Region (northeast Italy). The buffer was composed of a 5-m wide grass strip and a 1-m wide row of trees. Maize and wheat were cultivated in the neighbouring field during the monitoring period (December 1997-June 1999). Four experimental conditions were monitored, deriving from a combination of two levels of crop N fertilisation and two sizes of buffer trees. The narrow buffer was very effective in abating NO3-N concentrations, allowing water to be discharged with a concentration always below 2 ppm. Its zone of influence might be bigger than its simple width. The abatement was also efficient during winter. Tree size showed no evident effect on the reduction of the concentration.

AB  - The performance of a narrow buffer strip in abating dissolved P, electrical conductivity and herbicides (terbuthylazine, alachlor, nicosulfuron, pendimethalin, linuron) in subsurface water coming from cropland was tested in an experiment carried out on the low plains of the Veneto Region (NE Italy). The experiment lasted from December 1997 to June 1999, monitoring subsurface water quality entering and exiting a buffer composed of a grass strip (5 m wide) and 1 m wide row of trees. Dissolved phosphorus concentrations were reduced by almost 100% passing through the buffer and in most cases exiting water satisfied the limit for avoiding eutrophication. A positive effect was also detected on ECW (reduced by 20%), while pH was not significantly altered. Herbicide concentration abatement varied between 60 and 90%, depending on the chemical and the time elapsed since application.

AB  - Abstract: Buffer strips (BSs) are strips interposed between fields and streams that intercept and treat the waters leaving cropland, and so are a useful tool for reducing agricultural diffuse pollution in lowland areas. If properly vegetated and managed, they can also produce wood for burning, act as sinks for atmospheric CO2 and enhance the landscape beauty. The paper presents an analysis of the different functions of BS and reviews the more important data from research programmes conducted over the last decade in Veneto Region (North-East Italy). Over a period of 3–5 years, in two experimental sites, young BS reduced total runoff by 33%, losses of N by 44% and P by 50% compared to no-BS. A mature BS was able to abate both NO3–N and dissolved phosphorus concentrations by almost 100%, in most cases having exiting water that satisfied the limit for avoiding eutrophication. The BS also proved to be a useful barrier for herbicides, with concentrations abated by 60% and 90%, depending on the chemical and the time elapsed since application. Considering the CO2 immobilized in the wood and soil together, the different BS monitored stored up to 80tha−1 year−1. The BS caused negligible disturbance to maize, soybean and sugarbeet yields. The hedgerows, particularly if composed of trees taller than 6m, positively influenced the aesthetic value of the territory, improving its perceived naturalness and screening the man-made elements. Lastly, through a multi-objective analysis, opportunity costs were estimated to support the public decision-maker in determining the subsidies to be paid to encourage farmers to plant BS.

AB  - Buffer strips are an efficient and economical way to reduce agricultural nonpoint source pollution. Local researches are necessary to gain information on buffer performance, with particular emphasis on narrow buffers. The effect of a 6 m buffer strip (BS) in reducing runoff, suspended solids and nutrients from a field growing maize, winter wheat and soybean was assessed in a field experiment conducted in North-East Italy during 1998-2001. The BS was composed of two rows of regularly alternating trees (Platanus hybrida Brot.) and shrubs (Viburnum opulus L.), with grass (Festuca arundinacea L.) in the inter-rows. The BS reduced total runoff by 78% compared to no-BS, in which cumulative runoff depth was 231 mm over 4 years. With no-BS runoff appeared to be influenced mostly by total rainfall, while with BS maximum rainfall intensity was more important. The filtering effect of the BS reduced total suspended solids (TSS), particularly after the second year, when the median yearly concentrations ranged from 0.28 to 0.99 mg L-1 and were smaller than 0.14 mg L-1, with no-BS and with BS respectively. The combination of lower concentrations and runoff volumes significantly reduced TSS losses from 6.9 to 0.4 t ha(-1) over the entire period. A tendency to increased concentrations of all forms of N (total, nitrate and ammonium) while passing through the BS was observed. but total N losses were reduced from 17.3 to 4.5 kg ha(-1) in terms of mass balance. On the contrary, P concentrations were unmodified (soluble P), or lowered (total P) by the BS, reducing total losses by about 80%. The effect on total P, composed mainly of sediment-bound forms, was related to particulate settling when passing through the BS. A numerical index (Eutrophic Load Index), integrating water quality and runoff volumes, was created to evaluate the eutrophication risk of runoff with or without the BS. It showed that the BS effect was mostly due to a reduction of runoff volumes rather than improving the overall water quality. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In recent years, an intense debate about the environmental risks posed by neonicotinoids, a group of widely used, neurotoxic insecticides, has been joined. When these systemic compounds are applied to seeds, low concentrations are subsequently found in the nectar and pollen of the crop, which are then collected and consumed by bees. Here we demonstrate that the current focus on exposure to pesticides via the crop overlooks an important factor: throughout spring and summer, mixtures of neonicotinoids are also found in the pollen and nectar of wildflowers growing in arable field margins, at concentrations that are sometimes even higher than those found in the crop. Indeed, the large majority (97%) of neonicotinoids brought back in pollen to honey bee hives in arable landscapes was from wildflowers, not crops. Both previous and ongoing field studies have been based on the premise that exposure to neonicotinoids would occur only during the blooming period of flowering crops and that it may be diluted by bees also foraging on untreated wildflowers. Here, we show that exposure is likely to be higher and more prolonged than currently recognized because of widespread contamination of wild plants growing near treated crops.

AB  - Within agricultural landscapes, linear features such as hedgerows and tree-lines provide valuable habitat for many species. We use data from 315 transects, completed as part of a national acoustic survey of bat distribution, to examine the incidence of four bat species adjacent to linear features in rural areas. The use of linear features was assessed in relation to hedgerow width, tree density, the presence of water and woodland proximity. To examine the effect of tree density, linear features were classified as either hedgerows without trees, hedgerows with sparse trees (comprising <50% tree canopy) or tree-lines (>50% tree canopy). The use of linear features by Pipistrellus pipstrellus was not affected by tree density; linear features of all types were associated with a similar increase in P. pipistrellus incidence. The use of linear features by Pipistrellus pygmaeus was dependent on both tree density and the proximity of woodland; only linear features containing trees provided an increase in P. pygmaeus incidence regardless of woodland proximity. P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus incidence was not affected by hedgerow width or the presence of water. Incidence of Nyctalus noctula and Eptesicus serotinus was unaffected by the density of linear features of any type. Many agri-environment schemes offer financial incentives for the creation and management of hedgerows. Optimising the biodiversity gain provided by linear features will maximise the effectiveness of these schemes. Agri-environment measures that encourage the provision and retention of hedgerow trees will benefit bats in agricultural landscapes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Patterns of plant assemblages in habitats located within agroecosystems are poorly understood. A study of the seedbank and standing vegetation in 10 soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] fields, their adjacent boundaries, and adjoining woody hedgerows was undertaken in Ontario. The objective was to examine the composition of plants of conservation value and weedy species in these habitats. The seedbank of each habitat was determined from soil cores in quadrats located at regular intervals along transects, using the seedling emergence method in the greenhouse. The vegetation was surveyed in plots adjacent to the seedbank sampling areas. There was no significant difference in total species richness of vegetation or the seedbank among habitat types. However, there was a marked difference in species composition. In the seedbank, no difference in weed species richness among habitats was observed. In vegetation, however, fields harboured significantly more weedy species than adjacent boundaries and hedgerows. The dissimilarity between the seedbank and the vegetation was confirmed in detrended correspondence analyses, which showed that hedgerow vegetation, and to a lesser extent boundary vegetation, differed from field vegetation and all the habitats of the seedbank. The analysis of soil properties indicated that organic matter and nutrient levels were often higher in hedgerows than in fields. It can be concluded that hedgerows are valuable habitats for plant diversity and that weed species represent a minor component of their overall vegetation composition.

AB  - In intensive agricultural areas small woodlots and woody hedgerows constitute the only remnant of natural forested habitats. Because they are reduced in size and are surrounded by farmlands, remnant habitats may be impacted by several abiotic factors. The conservation value of these habitats, however, cannot be fully ascertained while plant species richness and composition remain unknown. We describe the vegetation composition of woodlot edges and hedgerows associated with agricultural fields of different farming intensities. We inventoried thirteen woodlot edges and hedgerows in each of three types of farming systems characterized mainly by different frequency of tillage and by different levels of herbicide and fertilizer use. The number and percentage cover of species present did not differ greatly between farming regimes whereas the species composition varied considerably. In habitats adjacent to intensively farmed fields, we found more short-lived grassy-type plants that were largely of introduced origin and of weedy propensity. Conversely, more species typical of the maple-tree association were found in habitats abutting less intensively managed fields. Species composition and abundance also differed with distances into the woodlots and hedgerows. These effects were more noticeable in woodlot edges than in hedgerows. We discuss the results in relation to their conservation as well as their agronomic implications. We suggest that a buffer strip at the edge of cultivated fields may be sufficient for the protection of native plants in woodlots (and probably of other wildlife) and, to a lesser extent, of hedgerows. Furthermore, buffer strips may reduce weed interaction between crop and non-crop habitats.

AB  - Plants of riparian habitats located between cropfields and linear watercourses, i.e., drainage ditches, streams, small rivers, situated in the Boyer river watershed were inventoried in Quebec, eastern Canada. The main objectives of this study were to establish the contribution of narrow riparian habitat strips to plant biodiversity in farming landscape and to document whether they could be reservoir of weeds detrimental to agriculture. Twenty-nine sections (>400 m) of riparian habitats adjacent to cropfields were inventoried in summer 1996 and spring 1997, and these were grouped into five vegetation types: (1) herbaceous strips dominated by grasses and devoid of woody species, (2) herbaceous strips dominated by forbs also devoid of woody species, (3) strips with small (<2 m) shrubs, (4) strips with tall (between 2 and 10 m) shrubs, and (5) strips with mature trees (>10 m). A total of 280 (228 herbaceous and 52 woody) plant species were recorded. Overall habitats with trees contained a larger number of herb and woody species than other riparian habitats. However, this was not reflected in the species richness per unit area (quadrats) which meant that habitats with trees were more heterogeneous than other habitat types. Species composition differed considerably among the various riparian habitats when considering forest spring ephemerals, ferns, forbs in general, grasses and woody vegetation. Substantially more native wetland species (obligate and facultative) were recorded adjacent to watercourses than near fields. More weedy and in particular, introduced species, were found in quadrats sampled near cropfields. Although no plant species of special conservation value were located in the riparian habitats, they should deserve special protection in intensive agricultural areas because they harbour a suite of wetland plants (and animals) not found in other farmland habitats. This appears to be especially desirable for those habitats with a well-developed woody vegetation. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hedgerows and field margins are common features of the agricultural landscape in southern Quebec. In the last decade, hedgerow establishment has been encouraged primarily for the prevention of soil erosion, though many farmers view them as reservoirs of invasive weeds and pests. In this study, we compared weed assemblages of several hedgerow types and herbaceous field margins. Ranking that takes into consideration weed abundance was clearly demonstrated: planted hedgerows > herbaceous field margins > natural woody hedgerows. The latter harboured many perennial plant species of less weedy propensity than planted hedgerows, which accommodated a larger number of weedy species. In planted hedgerows close to 50% of plants were weeds, even in their central position, although planted and natural hedgerows sheltered similar weed composition in their central parts. Likewise, most species inventoried in adjacent fields were weeds. Weeds characterising the central position of hedgerows/field margins were often species of wet habitats (Lythrum salicaria L., Equisetum arvense L., Cicuta maculata L.). Management practices of hedgerows and perhaps of crop fields adjacent to hedgerows may be mostly responsible for the abundance of weeds in hedgerows and field margins.

AB  - Arthropods were inventoried in crop fields and adjacent woody hedgerows of organic and conventional farms situated in south-central Ontario, Canada. The objective was to assess the total abundance, family richness, and composition of beneficial and phytophagous arthropods in the 2 farming systems and to examine the contributions of the vegetation present and landscape features on arthropod abundance and composition. Two hundred and forty sticky traps were installed (24 sites) and 170 sweep net collections were conducted (17 sites) in crop fields and adjacent woody hedgerows of organic and conventional sites. A total of 30 807 individual arthropods belonging to 131 families were recorded during the study. No spatial autocorrelation was detected among the arthropod samples. The study showed that beneficial and phytophagous arthropod abundance differed between organic and conventional sites (only with sweep net) but family richness did not. Beneficial arthropods were more abundant in woody hedgerows, while phytophagous arthropods were more abundant in crop fields. This study also demonstrated a strong relationship between plant and arthropod composition. Habitats (total old field cover, total hedgerow length, and Shannon diversity index, all within 250 m radius) in the surrounding landscape influenced arthropod composition but were not leading factors in explaining richness and abundance. It is therefore of prime importance to consider both local factors (management practices and local vegetation) and regional factors such as landscape features as explanatory variables when attempting to explain biodiversity.

AB  - The patterns of distribution of insects [most notably hymenopterous parasites and Chrysopidae and Syrphidae, all enemies of cereal aphids] in and near a tall (H = 7 m), complex hedgerow were measured with suction traps in 2 consecutive years. Two suction traps were sited in the hedgerow on the eastern and western sides respectively, another at a distance of 3H in the middle of a wheat crop east of the hedgerow and a 4th over a weedy site 8H east of the hedgerow. In both years insects were most numerous on the western side of the hedgerow irrespective of speed and direction of wind. Numbers of insects were smallest in the trap at 3H but in the trap at 8H were greater, though less than on either side of the hedgerow. This pattern of distribution appeared to be determined primarily by the comparative richness of the vegetation surrounding trapping sites, the western side of the hedgerow having the most varied flora.

AB  - Pitfall traps were used to monitor predatory arthropod numbers along two types of field boundary, a post and wire fence line and a Cupressus macrocarpa hedge, along the same paddock margin in Canterbury, New Zealand, over 24 months. The seven most abundant predator groups recorded were: Araneae > Phalangiidae > Staphylinidae > Coccinellidae > Chilopoda > Hemerobiidae > Carabidae. Araneae, Phalangiidae, Staphylinidae, Chilopoda and Hemerobiidae were found in larger numbers at the wire fence than at the hedge site, whereas the numbers of Carabidae and Coccinellidae adults exhibited no field margin preference. However, more species of Araneae and Staphylinidae were caught at the hedge site, whereas species richness of carabid beetles was greatest at the wire fence. Principal component analysis clearly separated the samples collected from the two habitats based on the assemblages of Araneae, Staphylinidae and Carabidae, and certain species in each of these taxonomic groups appeared to be particularly associated with one boundary type or the other. All the main taxonomic groups exhibited clear seasonal patterns, with distinct peaks in abundance occurring at certain times of the year. The results of the study reinforce the idea that management of field boundaries can be used to manipulate the type and abundance of particular groups of predatory arthropods, and that seasonal patterns should be taken into account in schemes of integrated pest management so that any adverse effects of biocide application on these beneficial species may be minimised.

AB  - ABSTRACT Since the 1960s, habitat loss resulting from cleaner farming, increased urbanization, and maturation of early successional cover has caused range-wide decline of northern bobwhite ( Colinus virginianus). Although field borders increase bobwhite habitat and increase local populations, understanding how the surrounding landscape influences bobwhite response to this management practice is critical to efficient implementation. We determined the relative influence of landscape composition and field border implementation on bobwhite densities and occupancy dynamics around crop fields in North Carolina and South Carolina, USA. We used 10-minute distance point counts to estimate density, occupancy, colonization, and extinction rates of male bobwhite around 154 agriculture fields, half of which had a fallow field border. We estimated percent of cropland, forest, pasture, early successional, and urban cover within 1-km radius buffers (314 ha) surrounding all point count locations. We examined the influence of 6 predictor variables (landscape composition metrics and field border presence) on bobwhite density and occupancy dynamics. Bobwhite density increased with the presence of field borders. Conversely, bobwhite density decreased as the percentage of urban, pasture, and forest lands increased. The presence of a field border did not influence occupancy, colonization, or extinction rates. However, as the percentage of cropland increased within the landscape, bobwhite occupancy increased and as the percentage of pasture increased, bobwhite colonization decreased. As the percentage of forest and urban increased and cropland decreased, bobwhite extinction rate increased. Our results indicated that local establishment of field borders does not increase bobwhite occupancy rates, but field borders can increase densities in suitable landscapes where bobwhite are present. Habitat restoration for bobwhite will most effectively increase population densities if focused in landscapes dominated by suitable cover types, where bobwhite occurrence is high. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Barren soil borders, weed border treatments and caged barren soil were evaluated for their effect on movement of the twospotted spider mite, T. urticae Koch, into peanut fields. In field cage tests when a 3, 4.5 or 6 m strip of barren soil separated a source of mite-infestation from initially mite-free peanut, mite damage to peanut was inversely related to the distance of barren soil crossed. In uncaged field tests, similar barren soil borders did not prevent mite movement into peanut fields; however, the number of mites were inversely related to the distance from the field border. There were no significant differences among weed border treatments and total numbers of mites entering peanut fields over time. There were differences among weed border treatments on early mite movement and establishment trends into peanut fields. Mowing weed borders significantly increased the number of aerially dispersing twospotted spider mites within the adjacent peanut field.

AB  - Forested riparian buffer strips are recommended as an agricultural best management practice for protection of water quality and for wildlife habitat. Since the 1990s, federal and state conservation agencies in Virginia have been involved in establishment of riparian buffers under the auspices of programs, such as the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). Riparian buffers established by the CREP program are considered to be beneficial towards the protection of water quality However, the benefit is based upon assumption that planted trees and shrubs survive and grow Little evaluation has been done within the state to document the success of the establishment efforts. We evaluated 63 riparian planting sites located in the Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and Ridge and Valley physiographic provinces of Virginia. Overall, the riparian forests in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont were fully stocked due to a combination of planted and natural regeneration. Riparian forests in the Ridge and Valley region were inadequately stocked, and the region has problems with invasive, exotic species. Major recommendations for improving the success of future riparian restoration;and establishment efforts are to (1) include the potential for natural regeneration when planning CREP plantings, (2) stop mechanized operations in the riparian buffers that reduce planted and natural regeneration (e.g., mowing and disking), (3) reduce herbivory (particularly cattle) within the riparian buffer, and (4) control invasive exotic species as necessary.

AB  - 1. Yellowhammers began to decline on British lowland farmland in the late 1980s and losses are presently 10% per year. This study examined variation in the habitat selection and breeding success of yellowhammers, allowing an evaluation of whether Britain's yellowhammer decline might have been caused by recent changes in agriculture. 2. Yellowhammer territories were associated with hedgerows, vegetated ditches and wide uncultivated grassy margins around fields. Pasture and silage leys were avoided. Nests were built among herbaceous vegetation in ditches or in the shrubby vegetation of hedgerows. 3. Breeding started slightly earlier on organic farms than on intensively managed farms, but no measure of breeding success differed between farm types. Predation was the cause of most (64%) nest failures. A maximum of three breeding attempts (two successful) was observed per pair, with a mean clutch size of 3·3, a Mayfield nest success rate of 0·46, and 2·6 nestlings fledged per successful brood. These data, together with published estimates of adult yellowhammer survival and of post-fledging survival among other passerines, suggest that breeding productivity is too low to maintain a stable population. 4. The removal of hedgerows or abandonment of hedge management, filling or clearing of ditches, intensification of grassland management and cropping or grazing right up to the field edge, are all likely to have adversely affected yellowhammers on lowland farmland in southern England. Policy reforms that redirect subsidy support to environmentally beneficial management of field margin habitats and retention of winter-feeding sites such as stubbles should assist in restoring populations of breeding yellowhammers on lowland farmland. 5. Our data expand further the array of farmland bird species for which interactions between agricultural change and population change are increasingly understood.

AB  - Abstract: Vegetated riparian buffer strips have been established in Southern Quebec (Canada) in order to intercept nutrients such as nitrate (NO3−) and protect water quality near agricultural fields. Buffer strips may also favour denitrification through a combination of high soil moisture, NO3− and carbon supply, which could lead to the production of nitrous oxide (N2O), a greenhouse gas. Denitrification could be further amplified by the presence of earthworms, or by plant species that promote earthworm and bacterial activity in soils. Soils from four farms, comprising maize fields and adjacent buffer strips, were sampled in the fall of 2008. A total of six earthworm species were found, but average earthworm biomass did not differ between buffer strips and maize agroecoecosystems. Nitrate concentrations and net nitrification rates were higher in the maize fields than in the buffer strips; there was no difference in N2O production in soils collected from the two sampling locations. Potential denitrification, measured by acetylene inhibition, varied by two orders of magnitude, depending on experimental conditions; when amended with H2O or with H2O+NO3−, potential denitrification was higher (P <0.05) in soils from buffer strips than from maize fields. Potential denitrification was highest in soils amended with H2O+glucose, or with H2O+NO3− +glucose. Using microcosms, we tested the effect of litter–soil mixtures on earthworm growth, and the effect of earthworm-litter–soil mixtures on potential denitrification. Based on four categories of chemical assays, litters of woody species (oak, apple, Rhododendron) were generally of lower nutritional quality than litter from agronomic species (alfalfa, switchgrass, corn stover). Alfalfa litter had the most positive effect, whereas apple litter had the most negative effect, on earthworm growth. Potential denitrification was 2–4 times higher in earthworm–litter–soil mixtures than in plain soil. Litter treatments that included corn stover had lower potential denitrification than those that included alfalfa or switchgrass, whereas litter treatments that included oak had lower potential denitrification than those that included apple or Rhododendron. Results suggest that potential N2O emissions may be higher in riparian buffer strips than in adjacent maize fields, that N2O emissions in buffer strips may be amplified by comminuting earthworms, and that plant litters that reduce earthworm growth may not be best at mitigating N2O emissions.

AB  - We field tested a short term, in situ method for measuring highly variable shallow groundwater denitrification rates using a methodology developed in an earlier, laboratory phase of this study, A pulse of tracer solution was injected and subsequently sampled within well clusters 50 cm in radius, The injectate contained dissolved acetylene (C(2)H(2)) to block denitrification at the nitrous oxide (N(2)O) stage of reduction, Six well clusters were established at two depths along a riparian area transect through field, grass, and woodland ecotypes. Bromide tracer, C(2)H(2), and accumulated N(2)O were monitored at sample wells downgradient from each injection well, Adequate C(2)H(2) concentrations (0.43 mM) to block N(2)O reduction between injection and sample wells were attained in five of the six well clusters tested. Acetylene peak concentrations moved laterally an average of 19% more slowly than the Br peak, N(2)O peak concentrations an average of 8% after C(2)H(3) peaks, Highest denitrification rates of 2.8 and 3.3 mg N L(-1) d(-1) were observed near the surface of the water table within the grass buffer and riparian forest. Shallow groundwater denitrification rates in the adjoining field and 2 m deep into the saturated zone at all three ecotypes were <25% of the highest rates. Acetylene block procedures were thus used to determine in situ denitrification rates within a few days time with little disruption of soil structure or associated microbial communities, Portable equipment allows application at remote sites independent of line power and road access.

AB  - Species conservation largely depends on knowledge of habitat needs of target species. GIS-models are increasingly used to assess habitat preferences and distribution of target species, but their accuracy is constrained by availability of digital data layers. We developed a two-steps approach aiming at showing pros and cons of landscape (GIS)- and site-level habitat models, identifying key habitat factors for conservation of a threatened bird species, the red-backed shrike Lanius collurio. A spatially explicit GIS-model was generated using landscape variables, and a second model at site level was developed using fine-scale variables measured on the ground. The GIS-based model was then extrapolated to the entire region to obtain a map of distribution of suitable habitats. Positive associations between shrike occurrence and both hedgerow length and partial shrub cover were detected at both scales. Shrikes were also positively associated with grassland cover at landscape level and with partial cover of untilled herbaceous vegetation at the finer scale, and negatively affected by lucerne cover. The GIS-model led to an affordable map of predicted habitat suitability which should help conservationists to focus on different local priorities, but was unable to identify effects of untilled and lucerne cover. Site-level model gave fine details for habitat management, but its application elsewhere requires ground-measurements of factors. Combining the multiscale models could indicate more urgent actions at large scales (e.g. maintaining suitable habitats, or improving connectivity among isolated patches) and draw a detailed figure of the most suitable habitat for the species. Shrike occurrence was associated with a higher number of shrub and tree species: the indicator value of the species should ensure general benefits for biodiversity from dedicated management. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess factors affecting Corn Bunting occurrence and abundance, and to evaluate its potential to indicate the diversity and abundance of other buntings. The study was conducted in Lombardy, N Italy, at 40 sites in a low-intensity agricultural landscape. Corn Bunting occurrence depended on the availability of arable land and, secondarily, of rocky areas. Its abundance was affected by the extent of arable land and length of continuous hedgerows. The number of species and territories of other buntings was higher at sites where Corn Buntings were more abundant. Measures aiming at species' conservation should primarily promote the maintenance of arable lands and hedgerows in low-intensity agricultural areas. These landscape features are threatened in the Mediterranean region by both agricultural intensification and land abandonment. Conservation measures for Corn Buntings may also benefit the other bunting species.

AB  - The winter habitat use, winter diet and nesting habitat of Corn Buntings Miliaria calandra were studied on the South Downs, south-east England. The most heavily used habitat relative to availability was initially cereal stubbles in early winter, but subsequently cattle feed and then spring-sown cereals. These habitats and brassica strips with game feeders provided access to cereal grain, which was present in virtually all faecal samples. Grassy field margins and spring-sown barley were used for nesting more than expected from their availability. Winter-sown wheat was used for nesting roughly as expected by chance and improved grass was avoided. Cereals were important to Corn Buntings throughout the year. Spring-sown cereals may be particularly valuable. During the winter they provided long-lasting stubbles and abundant food in the form of surface grain when first sown. In the breeding season, they were among the most used habitats for nesting and for collecting chick food. Agri-environment schemes to benefit Corn Buntings should support spring-sown cereal crops and smaller-scale measures such as the creation and maintenance of grassy field margins.

AB  - Many species of farmland birds have shown huge declines in numbers and range since the 1970s due to agricultural intensification, and these declines have been worst amongst granivorous species. Recent studies have suggested that low abundance of invertebrate chick food may have been important in driving the declines of a number of granivorous species, however causation has still only been proved for the Grey Partridge, whose decline has been attributed to low chick survival due to the indirect effects of herbicides reducing invertebrate abundance. We investigated invertebrate declines and how they may have affected farmland bird populations in a number of ways. There is little long-term data on abundance of farmland invertebrates. Thus we first looked at how representative data from a long-running suction trap was of invertebrate abundance on local farmland. Suction trap catches reflected abundance of aerial invertebrates on local farmland, and also to abundance of epigeal invertebrates in many cases, particularly abundances in predominant crop types. Secondly, we looked at spatial and temporal distribution of invertebrates on farmland in order to make recommendations about how to increase invertebrate availability to farmland bird populations. Field margins were by far the most invertebrate rich habitats sampled. Most differences in invertebrate abundance between different crop types were found early in the season, at this time spring barley and spring oilseed rape had very low abundances. Winter wheat had relatively high invertebrate abundance compared to spring barley at this time. Winter oilseed rape and set-aside had relatively high abundances of the crop types sampled. We investigated how low invertebrate abundance may have affected populations of granivorous passerines by looking for evidence of reproductive trade-offs in a population of Tree Sparrows, and by supplementary feeding experiments with Tree Sparrow and Yellowhammer chicks. There was no evidence for reproductive trade-offs within years, conversely an effect of individual quality was found. There was some evidence of reproductive trade-offs between years. Supplementary feeding increased the mass of Tree Sparrow first broods early in May but not later in May, and also of chicks with yearling parents, who had a lower provisioning rate. Chicks fledged early in May had a lower survival rate to the following year than chicks fledged later, supplementary feeding and parental age had no effect on chick survival. Supplementary feeding a parent's first brood had no effect on their later reproductive output that season, or on their survival to the next breeding season. Supplementary feeding Yellowhammer chicks early season increased their mass, but had no effect later in the season. This complies with results from a previous study of Yellowhammers in southern England, which showed that a higher proportion of chicks fledge late in the season. Further analysis of this data showed that this was because chicks were more likely to starve early in the season, and also that chick mass was lower early season, even when just looking at chicks which went on to fledge. Thus, it would appear that low invertebrate abundance was affecting the granivorous passerines looked at most in the early season, and through chick mass and survival. Measures to increase invertebrate abundance at this time would be beneficial to populations of granivorous passerines.

AB  - Agri-environment schemes (AES) are the main policy mechanism available to reverse the widespread losses of farmland biodiversity across Europe. Previous examples of AES enhancing the abundance of farmland birds have been restricted to targeted species recovery programmes, often with bespoke habitat management and high levels of advisory support for landowners. Here, we tested whether standard higher-tier AES agreements targeted at multiple species and with lower levels of advisory support than targeted species recovery programmes can enhance the breeding densities of farmland birds. Surveys of breeding birds were undertaken during 2008 and 2011 on 65 farms under higher level stewardship (HLS) and 21 farms lacking AES interventions, in three regions of England. After allowing for any impacts of predator control, changes in density were more positive on HLS farms in at least one region for six priority species. Five of the six species had mixed diets and were predominantly associated with field edges; the other (lapwing) probably responded to the provision of field-centre fallow plots. Changes in bird numbers were not consistently related to the extent of AES habitat provision. This is the first study to demonstrate that standard AES management without substantial ongoing advisory support can increase or maintain the densities of widespread declining species.

AB  - 1. The grey partridge is a species of conservation concern, in common with many farmland birds. Its widespread decline in western Europe has been attributed to agricultural intensification. Attempts to restore populations have concentrated upon habitat management. In France, a mosaic of strips planted with maize- or kale-based mixtures is widely used to benefit the grey partridge on intensively cultivated farmlands. The rationale for planting these summer-to-winter cover strips is to increase the overwinter survival rate and hence breeding density. Although this policy is costly to apply, there is little information on its effectiveness. 2. We tested effectiveness of this management scheme as a practical way of improving or restoring partridge populations. We present data from a 6-year before-after control-impact (BACI) experiment replicated across four study sites. We monitored partridge populations to estimate breeding density, reproductive success and overwinter mortality. 3. During the course of the study, no partridge population increase occurred on managed areas compared with control areas. Wildlife cover strips did not improve reproductive success but were associated with higher overwinter 'apparent mortality' rates. 4. Some field data suggested that there was a predation risk at cover strip-field edges. Cover strips may concentrate a number of species within small isolated areas and may act, under some circumstances, as an ecological trap for prey species such as the grey partridge. Due to these complex and unforeseen interactions, this habitat management measure proved unsuitable for partridge restoration. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study has demonstrated the necessity of field experiments at a farm-scale to test the effectiveness of habitat management schemes. A priori assumptions based on smaller scale studies, even if they are supported by some field evidence, can be misleading because they fail to capture the emergent properties of larger scale systems. This study is a specific illustration of how the BACI approach is a powerful tool for addressing wildlife management problems at large spatial scales.

AB  - The decline of farmland biodiversity over much of Europe has been largely attributed to agricultural intensification. Since the 1970s, governments have introduced agri-environment schemes (AES) aimed at mitigating this impact, but information on their success is limited. A five y, farm-scale experiment was conducted to test the efficacy of England's Environmental Stewardship AES in enhancing the species richness and abundance of small mammals (voles Cricetidae, mice Muridae, and shrews Soricidae) in an intensively-farmed arable landscape. Small mammal communities were sampled in spring and autumn on grassy field margins installed under the Entry Level Scheme (ELS) tier of Environmental Stewardship, where 1% of cropped land was converted to wildlife habitats. Results were compared with those from field margins on a second, experimental treatment (ELS Extra: ELSX) in which 5% of cropped land was taken out of production, and also field margins on a conventionally-farmed control treatment ('cross compliance': CC). Species richness and abundance of small mammals showed a significant increase on all treatments in spring and autumn. Many increases were greater on ELS and ELSX field margins compared to the CC controls, but there was little evidence that ELSX was more beneficial than ELS, and there were species-specific differences. Voles were not detected on any treatment in the initial sampling period but bank voles Myodes glareolus rapidly became abundant thereafter, particularly on ELS and ELSX field margins, and field voles Microtus agrestis also colonised. Wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus were present on all treatments in all sampling periods, but spring abundance declined as vole abundance increased. These results suggest that the Entry Level Scheme tier of the English agri-environment scheme is effective in enhancing small mammal communities on arable farmland, with potential benefits for higher trophic levels via their predators.

AB  - Species abundance in local communities is determined by bottom-up and top-down processes, which can act directly and indirectly on the focal species. Studies examining these effects simultaneously are rare. Here we explore the direct top-down and direct and indirect bottom-up forces regulating the abundance and predation success of an intermediate predator, the web-building spider Argiope bruennichi (Araneae: Araneidae). We manipulated plant diversity (2, 6, 12 or 20 sown species) in 9 wildflower strips in a region of intensive farmland. To identify the major factors regulating the distribution and abundance of A. bruennichi, we quantified three characteristics of vegetation (species diversity, composition and vegetation structure) as well as the spider's prey community and natural enemies. The distribution and abundance of A. bruennichi was regulated by combined bottom-up and top-down processes as well as by direct and indirect interactions between trophic levels. Four main factors were identified: (1) the strong direct effect of vegetation structure, (2) the positive effect of plant species diversity, which affected spider abundance directly and indirectly through increased densities and size of flower-visiting prey species, (3) the positive or negative direct effects of different plant species, and (4) the strongly negative direct effect of predacious hornets. The advantage of taking a global approach to understand the regulation of species abundance is highlighted first by the quantification of the relative importance of factors, with a surprisingly strong effect of hornet predators, and second by the discovery of a direct effect of plant diversity, which raises intriguing questions about habitat selection by this spider.

AB  - Grassed waterways have been used for decades to prevent soil erosion in agricultural cropland, but their benefits to wildlife had not been evaluated prior to our study. We document bird species composition and relative abundance during the breeding season in 44 grassed waterways in central Iowa. The waterways were planted predominately to smooth brome (Bomus inermis) and were in cornfields and soybean fields. Forty-eight bird speices were observed in waterways, compared with only 14 in the surrounding crop fields. Red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), dickcissels (Spiza americana), barn swallows (Hirundo rustica), western meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta), brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) were the most abundant bird species in the grassed waterways. Total bird abundance in he grassed waterways averaged 2198 birds observed/census/100 ha compared with 682 in crop fields. Temporal patterns in bird abundance were attributed primarily to aspects of the waterways and surrounding cropland that changed over time, such as vegetation height. Because most (53%) of the bird species were at peak abundance in the waterways during 4-22 July, grassed waterways should not be mowed until the end of August or early September.

AB  - Over a five year period, terrestrial small mammals were sampled by snap trapping at a locality near the village of Vlkos, southern Moravia. Sampling was carried out in newly planted biocorridors, adjacent fields, and a forest area. In total, 452 individuals from eight small mammal species (six rodents and two insectivores) were recorded. The largest numbers of species (eight) were recorded in biocorridors, and Apodemus sylvaticus was eudominant in all habitats. The community of small mammals in the biocorridors was quantitatively similar to those in fields during the first phase of succession, but very different from the community in fully developed windbreaks, which more resembled the forest community. A close association between the small mammal communities in fields and biocorridors was found during the initial phase of biocorridor development, and individuals from field populations moved into biocorridors in the autumn, probably in response to agricultural activities.

AB  - In 1996–1999, different mortality factors of pollen beetle larvae were investigated in twenty six rape fields in the northern part of Switzerland which had either a wild flower strip or an extensively managed meadow adjacent to the long side of the field. At 3 and 30 m into the crop from the conservation strip, total mortality, mortality from predators, parasitoids and unspecified factors were measured. Total pollen beetle larval mortality was 66–96%. Mortality caused by predators was 16–27% and there was no significant difference between mortality at 3 m and that 30 m from the extensively managed meadows. However, in fields with wild flower strips adjacent to them, the percentage mortality from predators was significantly greater at 30 m than at 3 m. The range of parasitism of pollen beetle larvae was 0–54% and was on average greater at 3 m than at 30 m. In fields with wild flower strips, the percentage parasitism with Tersilochus heterocerus was significantly higher than in fields with extensively managed meadows. However, mortality from all parasitoids was only 1–2% and there was no significant difference between 3 and 30 m. The effect of parasitoids on pollen beetle mortality was masked by the high unspecified mortality and the mortality from predators. The unspecified mortality was 46–72% and was significantly greater in 1998 and 1999 than in 1996 and 1997. These differences are probably because of meteorological factors (wet in 1999 and dry in 1998). The possible influences of the two types of conservation strips on pollen beetle larval density were investigated. The results show that in fields with adjacent wild flower strips, the pollen beetle larvae were more evenly distributed (but not significantly so) than in fields with extensively managed meadows where larval density decreases faster from the edge into the rape field.

AB  - Generalist predators, such as spiders, play an important role as natural enemies in agroecosystems and, given the annual disturbance of most field crops, these predators typically re-colonize fields from adjacent habitats such as hedgerows or riparian forests. To test whether the biota of these source habitats differed, we collected ground-dwelling spiders (Araneae) from thin (< 15 m) riparian forests, wide (> 50 m) riparian forests and hedgerows (< 15 m wide) located next to soybean or corn fields in south-west Ohio. Pittall traps collected spiders at the stream edge, the interior of forests or hedgerows and the agricultural edge. Rarefaction analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination tested how spider diversity and community structure, respectively, differed between hedgerows and riparian forests and by trap location. Wide riparian forests harbored a higher diversity of spiders than thin riparian forests and hedgerows contained the lowest spider diversity. The latter result may be due in part to the invasive honeysuckle shrub Lonicera maackii in hedgerows, which can reduce habitat complexity on the ground-layer. Ordination analysis revealed the spider community found at the edge of hedgerows is distinct from other trap locations, as was the spider assemblage located adjacent to the stream, the latter containing some hygrophilous species. The spider fauna at the edge of hedgerows contained several species typically round in high densities in agricultural plots, supporting the need for these habitat ligatures in an agricultural landscape.

AB  - Abstract: We analysed the spatial distribution of home-ranges and the habitat use of re-introduced grey partridges Perdix perdix in relation to newly established ecologically enhanced areas, i.e. wild-flower strips and hedges, within an intensively cultivated area in Switzerland from which the species had become extinct. All birds settled within the ca. 30% of the study area where the proportion of enhanced areas was highest (5.8%). At the level of the individual family group, we found a significant over-proportional use of enhanced areas throughout the year. Furthermore, when the birds used the agricultural fields, the use densities strongly declined with distance from the nearest enhanced area. Thus, the availability and spatial distribution of ecologically enhanced areas were the main determinants of the partridges’ range use. These results indicate that a framework of ecologically enhanced areas is a key habitat structure for grey partridges, and that these enhancements, even if small in proportion, were the crucial first measure to restore the research area to an appropriate grey partridge habitat and, thus, the basis for successful re-introduction in this intensively cultivated area.

AB  - Structure and dynamics of a hedgerow network landscape over the last thirty years are compared to the current spatial distribution of carabid beetles in hedgerows. Spatial and temporal scales are chosen according to the observed phenomena, and a multiscale approach used. None of the descriptors of landscape at any given period of time is related to carabid assemblages except heterogeneity in 1985. This measure of landscape structure in Brittany integrates part of the recent changes. Carabid assemblages are also related to overall landscape trajectories through time. Relationship between landscape and carabid spatial patterns may be modeled at the stand and landscape levels. © 1992 SPB Academic Publishing bv.

AB  - Hedgerows, rows of trees or shrubs enclosing or separating fields, are man made. They are part of rural landscapes and should not be studied without considering the farming systems and the rural society as a whole. Their species composition depends on the history of the countryside, as well as current farming practices. Land use and boundary management play a major role in determining the floristic composition of hedgerows, and are strongly related to the grain size of the field's mosaic. Hedgerow networks, due to their rectilinear shape, and with their high degree of connection, enhance or interrupt many fluxes in the landscape. Hedgerows act as a corridor of movement and dispersal for many forest species, such as carabids, small mammals, and plants. On the other hand, hedgerows interrupt or slow down air fluxes and the propagules they carry. In the heterogeneous mosaic of fields and wooded patches, hedgerows often increase the functional connectivity of rural landscapes. The future of hedgerows depends on the changes of the rural society, which includes more and more nonfarmers. Hedgerows will be considered not only as a part of a productive area, but also as an element of a multifunctional landscape.

AB  - Hedgerow network landscapes may be considered as greenways, as they provide agronomic, ecological, aesthetic and cultural benefits. They are among the most threatened agricultural landscapes of western Europe. Intensification of agriculture with the conversion of permanent grassland into ploughed land and the use of new machinery leads to the enlargement of fields and the removal of hedgerows surrounding them. There is a growing concern among conservationists, rural managers and the public to maintain these greenways as a framework for landscape sustainability. In France, hedgerow removal may be planned within reallotment programmes that take into account all the land of a municipality. In this planning process, criteria for keeping or clearing woody elements are based on agronomic properties of soil, environmental quality of elements and of the network, and property boundaries. Aesthetic aspects are rarely assessed. As rural landscapes are shifting from an almost unique function of agricultural production toward a multifunction of nature conservation, environmental protection, amenity and production, the conservation of hedgerow networks becomes of greater importance. The goal is now the protection of these greenways to provide not only ecological but also recreational and cultural benefits. In a case study in Brittany, we tried to link these different aspects. Our work is based on interviews and a landscape ecological survey. We found contrasting opinions between farmers and non-farmers concerning the density of the network. Nevertheless, the two groups agree on the necessity to keep greenways as part of their cultural landscape. Most of the people were not aware of the ecological role of hedgerow networks, and perceive them only by their visual properties. We proposed various scenarios based on ecological and aesthetic principles, and defined general guidelines for the design of new landscapes during reallotment programmes. The integration of different points of view by landscape planners is the only way to link visual values to productive or ecological processes, and must be effective in the case of the management of greenways such as hedgerows. © 1995.

AB  - Conserving farmland birds is a key objective for agri-environment schemes (AES) across Europe, with a number of management options aimed at providing invertebrate food and nesting habitats. We analysed territory settlement by two widespread but declining farmland buntings with contrasting nesting requirements: the Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella, a boundary-nesting species, and the Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra, a ground-nesting species. The study was conducted on farms participating in the English Higher Level Stewardship scheme to test whether territory settlement is influenced by the provision of key arable AES options. Both species settled preferentially in localities containing sown arable field margins, while Corn Bunting also settled in localities containing nectar flower mixtures. These preferences are likely to reflect foraging rather than nesting habitat requirements. Yellowhammer selected territories containing hedgerows under AES management, which are nesting rather than foraging habitat but may also provide food. Uptake by land owners of several AES options likely to provide limiting resources for farmland birds was very low, and because uptake at the landscape scale is also low, wider-scale population level benefits are likely to be constrained. However, this is one of few studies demonstrating selection of widely applied arable AES options by breeding farmland birds.

AB  - Landscape structure as well as local vegetation influence biodiversity in agroecosystems. A study was performed to evaluate the effect of floristic diversity, vegetation patterns, and landscape structural connectivity on butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea and Hesperiidae), carabids (Coleoptera: Carabidae), syrphids (Diptera: Syrphidae), and sawflies (Hymenoptera: Symphyta). Vegetation analysis and insect samplings were carried out in nine sites within an intensively farmed landscape in northern Italy. Plant species richness and the percentage of tree, shrub, and herb cover were determined by means of the phytosociological method of Braun-Blanquet. Landscape structural connectivity was measured as the total length of hedgerow network (LHN) in a radius of 500 m around the center of each sampling transect. Butterflies species richness and abundance were positively associated both to herb cover and to plant species richness, but responded negatively to tree and shrub cover. Shrub cover was strictly correlated to both species richness and activity density of carabids. The species richness of syrphids was positively influenced by herb cover and plant richness, whereas their abundance was dependent on ligneous vegetation and LHN. Rarefaction analysis revealed that sawfly sampling was not robust and no relationship could be drawn with either vegetation parameters or structural connectivity. The specific responses of each insect group to the environmental factors should be considered in order to refine and optimize landscape management interventions targeting specific conservation endpoints.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess water quality in the Lake Oconee watershed and evaluate the best management practices used by cattle farms to reduce water contamination. Inorganic nutrient concentrations, algal abundance and faecal bacteria were highest in the cattle farming areas. The diatom community where cattle had no access was dominated by Achnanthidium minutissimum (Kutzing) Czarnecki and Fragilaria crotonensis Kitton, and in sites where cattle were allowed direct access to the lake, Asterionella formosa Hassal, Nitzschia palea (Kutzing) Smith and Navicula rostellata Kutzing dominated. The latter three taxa are well-known high-nutrient diatoms. High populations of green algae (coccoid Desmidiaceae) were found where cattle had access. Sources of faecal pollution were identified using polymerase chain reaction detection, with Bifidobacterium adolescentis as a marker of human faecal pollution and Bacteroides (BoBac) indicating cattle faecal pollution. Overall, riparian buffers were most effective at reducing pollution from cattle operations.

AB  - The broad purpose of the study described here was to assess the role of denitrification in riparian zones in ameliorating groundwater pollution through nitrate loss, and as a potential source of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere. A suitable riparian zone was identified at Cuddesdon Mill on the River Thame floodplain near Oxford, England. Measurements were made of water and nitrate moving from arable land through the riparian zone and into the river. Techniques to measure denitrification were tested and applied, and the factors controlling denitrification measured. While there was considerable potential for denitrification at the site, this was not realized because much of the water moving off the farmland bypassed the riparian zone, entering the river directly via springs or through gravel lenses beneath the floodplain soil. Management of this site would not reduce nitrate leaching unless the floodplain hydrology could be substantially modified, and the main conclusion is that nitrate buffer zones will only operate efficiently where the hydrology of the site is appropriate.

AB  - Calomys musculinus (Muridae, Sigmodontinae) is a small rodent species found in most central and northern Argentina. It is the reservoir of the Junin virus, ethiological agent of the Argentine Hemorrhagic Fever (FHA). In the present work we studied habitat selection by C. musculinus at different spatial scales in rural habitats where the landscape is mainly formed by cropfields, surrounded by weedy margins (borders). We found that C. musculinus selects borders over cropfields, but there were not differences between types of fields or types of borders. The structure of the spatial heterogeneity, which is mainly grouped between macrohabitats due to agrarian labors, did not allow to detect habitat selection, within cropfields and borders, for habitat patches larger than individual trap sites. Distribution between fields and borders was related to the green plant cover in early autumn, probably because of specific requirements of reproductive individuals. Within these habitats, we found differences in captures according to the presence of some plant species, which varied according to the season and the habitat.

AB  - This study deals with the changes in structure of small mammal assemblages (seven species) in linear field boundary habitats of an intensively cultivated agricultural landscape. Composition and structure of the community were studied through trapping techniques in two types of habitat including 27 trapping locations. Abundance of species was either influenced by season, habitat or both effects. Two main species assemblages were observed, according to habitat quality (woody versus grassy habitats). Two species (Apodemus sylvaticus and Sorex coronatus) showed marked fluctuations in abundance, and were mainly responsible for changes occurring in these two habitats during the year. The five other species influenced moderately the structure of the community along seasons. Both hedges and grassy banks have to be maintained to allow the achievement of biological cycle for all species. As a whole, small mammal abundance will be improved at the landscape scale by enhancing total hedge length while increasing areas of grass-dominated linear habitats will result in a more balanced diversity of the community.

AB  - In order to assess the relative role of local versus landscape variables on shrub species composition and the species richness of hedgerows, a multi-scale approach was used. Along with landscape heterogeneity indices, graph theory derived indices were used to explore physical connectivity in hedgerow networks. Variation partitioning was conducted by partial Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) for shrub species composition, and multiple regression for shrub species richness. Shrub species composition and shrub species richness are determined by several interrelated factors: (1) the influence of adjacent land use was weak, while other local variables, e.g. hedgerow type, management and structure variables, were more important; (2) broad spatial scales explained more variation in shrub species distribution in hedgerows than fine spatial scales, probably in relation to their dispersal syndromes; (3) the main factors explaining variation in shrub species composition were landscape patterns variables, and (4) shrub species richness, however, was principally explained by local variables. Therefore, local and landscape variables have balancing effects, and both should be considered when explaining species distribution in hedgerow networks. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bird damage to agricultural crops is an important cause of economic loss for farmers worldwide. Predictive habitat models relating bird abundance and damage to characteristics of the agricultural environment at multiple scales are a key tool for designing management programs to reduce impacts of birds on agricultural production. In this study, we explored habitat features influencing abundance and damage of monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus) to corn (Zea mays) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus) fields, as a basis for the design and evaluation of management strategies for preventing damage in the future. Using a multi-level approach, we evaluated within-field, field, and landscape variables at three spatial scales potentially related to monk parakeet abundance and damage in crop fields. Monk parakeet abundance and damage was greater in sunflower than in corn fields. Landscape variables, such as distance to nearest site with trees, percentage of landscape with trees, and availability of foraging sites for monk parakeets around the crop fields were more important than local variables in explaining monk parakeet damage to crop fields. However, local variables, such as field area, plant density and percentage of field border with trees, also were related to damage. Relationships varied depending on the crop under consideration and spatial scale of analysis. Based on this study, managers should consider both local and landscape factors when planning management measures to prevent bird damage to crops. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Grass hedges are widely applied on sloping croplands as a low-cost measure to reduce soil and nutrition loss. Therefore, it is important to understand the role of hedgerows in runoff and sediment processes. In this study, 36 field runoff simulation experiments were conducted in the red soil region of China to determine flow hydraulics and soil loss processes under 12 different hedgerow conditions. Specifically, two types of hedgerow widths (two-row and three-row) were planted for each of three species of vegetation (Bahia grass (Paspalum notatum), Vetiver (Vetiveria nigtitana) and Daylily (Hemerocallis fulva)), and these plots were tested both before and after the removal of the grass stems. Grass stems played an important role in decreasing the flow velocity and filtering sediment. For the three selected vegetation types, the final flow velocities (V3) were ranked in the following order: Bahia grass (0.12 m/s) < Vetiver (0.17 m/s) <Daylily (0.19 m/s). There was no significant difference between the three grass species in trapping sediment under the condition of this study. A comparison between the two different hedgerow widths revealed that the three-row hedges were more effective (decrease ratio >30%) than the two-row hedges (decrease ratio <20%) in reducing the flow velocity ahead of the grass barriers (V2). Nevertheless, soil losses from the grass hedges were mainly related to the final flow velocity (Pearson's R = 0.66, N = 36) rather than the V2. The final flow velocity and the total soil loss rate did not decrease remarkably when using the three-row hedges. These results could be used to provide sound field recommendations for designing and managing hedges in the red soil region of China. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Within the framework of a general decline in farmland biodiversity, sustainable management of field boundaries and margins has been widely recognized as one of the key approaches for incorporating conservation strategies within agronomic practices. The creation and sympathetic management of edges could improve abundance, diversity, and functional composition of farmland communities. Moreover, many species of arthropods inhabiting these habitats are natural enemies of crop pests and could play a valuable role in biological control. The aim of this research was to investigate the response of ground beetle assemblages to different management regimes in the rice field banks of an intensive agricultural area of northern Italy. Between May and November 2010, we collected carabids in 13 paddy banks (5 uncut, 4 mown twice, 4 cut monthly during June-September) by means of pitfall traps. Frequent cutting operations favoured assemblages dominated by generalist, mobile species, while more specialized ground beetles, such as predatory and short-winged ones, were associated with an absence or low levels of human disturbance. Our results suggest that environmentally friendly managed banks could help to ameliorate the persistence of species with poor dispersal ability and predator populations. Management implications for ground beetle conservation in rice ecosystem are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Olives, Olea europaea L., are one of the most important crops in Spain. They are currently produced under three management systems that involve different aspects of soil and pest management, productivity, and crop economy: organic, (integrated pest management-IPM), and conventional. Here, we studied how these systems affect the spiders, the natural enemies of olive grove pests, and performed a detailed analysis of their assemblage. The study was performed during one season in 18 olive groves in Andalusia, Spain, and included both ground-dwelling and canopy species.We found that the organic system supported a significantly higher level of abundance and diversity of canopy spiders than the IPM and conventional systems. Plowing had a negative effect on spider abundance and diversity. However, the presence of hedge vegetation had a positive effect on the spiders. The practices affected the guild structure differently, with some guilds supported by organic and others by IPM. It is suggested that sustainability (in terms of pest control) in olive grove agroecosystems may be obtained by maintaining hedge vegetation regardless of the management system. © The Authors 2015.

AB  - Vegetated buffer strips alongside watercourses are commonly used to counteract diffuse pollution from agricultural activities. If properly designed, they can provide multiple environmental benefits by increasing wildlife habitats and biodiversity. Little attention has been paid to the effects of buffer strips on soil quality. This study was conducted to determine the impact of different buffer designs on soil biochemical parameters and to define relevant quality parameters for soil monitoring. We compared four buffer arrangements: 3m wide grass buffer; 3m grass with one tree row; 6 m grass with one tree row; 6 m grass with two tree rows; plus two controls: an adjacent maize crop field and a plot without buffer. Buffers were established 13 years ago at the Padua University Experimental Farm in the Po Valley, north-east Italy. Studied parameters included soil organic matter composition and soil microbial and enzymatic assays. As expected, control plots showed the lowest values for all the studied parameters. Among buffer designs, 3m grass and 3m grass with 1 tree row buffers gave the highest values. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the increase of soil organic carbon content distinguished buffers from controls, whereas soil humic carbon quality parameters such as humic compounds apparent molecular weight, together with acetyl esterase (fluorescein test) enzyme activity, were discriminatory in separating buffer designs. These results are an important contribution to the knowledge base and can help to improve the management of these systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vegetative filter strips reduce herbicide runoff from cultivated fields owing to the ability of vegetation to delay surface runoff, promote infiltration, and adsorb herbicides. Previous research has shown that the annual runoff of each herbicide is typically less than 1 g ha−1. A model for the detection of the return period of rainfall events was recently proposed for a site in the north-eastern Po Valley, Italy. The return period model suggested that most of the herbicide loss by runoff (about 98%) is caused by a few, or even just one, extreme rainfall event with a return period of about 25–27 years, whereas ordinary events (4–5 each year) account for the rest. The present study aims to validate that model by comparing model predictions with the experimental results obtained in the 2010–2011 sampling season (independent test data), and to evaluate the effectiveness of the VFS. In addition, a 7-yr dataset of metolachlor and terbuthylazine concentration in real runoff events is summarised in order to highlight the medium-term magnitude of the pollution. Results show that on the Po Valley plain, 3–4 runoff events of low intensity are expected in spring–summer and that the consequent annual runoff of the herbicides metolachlor and terbuthylazine is about 0.5–0.7 g ha−1yr−1. A summary shows that, owing to their chemical-physical properties, concentrations of the two herbicides are similar, both varying from about 0.01–300 μg l−1, with a potential pulse-like exposure risk for aquatic communities in waterways. This study showed that vegetative filter strips can reduce herbicide transfer to surface water by 90–98%, and should be suggested for environmental schemes at field and catchment scale.

AB  - - Carabid beetles are important predators of arthropods and weed seeds in annual crops but may be limited in impact by the frequent and intense disturbances imposed on these systems. Pitfall trap sampling conducted in 1996 and 1997 examined the effect of refuge strips and cover crops on enhancing the seasonal activity-density of carabid beetles. The study site followed a soybean, Glycine max L. Merr, oats, Avena sativa L., and corn, Zea malls L., rotation. Refuges consisted of a central strip of 3 perennial flowering plants, Agastache foeniculun (Pursh) O. Kuntze, Origanum vulgare L., and Scropularia nodosa L, with orchard grass, Dactylis glomerata L., white clover, Trifolium repens L., and sweet clover, Melilotus officinalis L., seeded on each side. A cover crop was present only in 1996 and consisted of frost seeded red clover; Trifolium pratense L. A total of 5,117 and 2,316 carabid beetles was captured in pitfall traps comprising 14 species in 1996 and 20 species in 1997. Carabid beetle seasonal activity-density was greater (1996) or equal (1997) in refuge strips than in control areas without refuge strips; however, the presence of a refuge strip did not alter carabid populations in the surrounding subplots in either year. In 1996, subplots containing a cover crop had significantly higher carabid beetle activity-density than subplots without a cover crop. There was no carryover effect of cover crop on beetle activity-density in 1997. Among the most abundant species, a greater proportion of captures of the fall breeding species Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger), Pterostichus permundus (Say), and the spring breeding species Poecilus lucublandus (Say) occurred in the refuge strips. The spring breeders Poecilus chalcites (Say), Harpalus herbivagus Say, and Agonum cupripenne (Say), and the phytophagous fall breeder Harpalus pensylvanicus (De Geer) occurred in greater proportions in the crop areas. The potential use of these strategies for conserving carabid beetles in agricultural systems is discussed.

AB  - Laboratory and field studies were conducted during the summer-fall season of 1997 to evaluate the potential of the field cricket Gryllus pennsylvanicus Burmeister as a weed seed predator in annual crops. Laboratory no-choice tests showed that both male and female G. pennsylvanicus readily accepted and consumed seeds of small and large-seeded annual weeds. In 24 h, female and male G. pennsylvanicus consumed an average of 12 and 8 velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medic.), 26 and 9 giant foxtail (Setaria faberi Herrm.), 87 and 69 crabgrass [Digitaria Sanguinalis (L.) Scop.], and 223 and 90 redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) seeds, respectively. Tests of pitfall trap sampling in outdoor arenas showed that G. pennsylvanicus is susceptible to this sampling technique. Pitfall traps were subsequently used to monitor activity-density of G. pennsylvanicus in a soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) field and 2 adjacent perennial filter strips, one composed of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and the other an alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and timothy grass (Pheum pratense L.) mixture. G. pennsylvanicus individuals were first captured in early August, peaked in mid-September, and decreased in October. Field cricket activity-density was greatest in switchgrass filter strip followed by legume-grass filter strip and lowest in soybean.

AB  - In south-eastern Australia, strips of planted native trees and shrubs (shelterbelts) are frequently established to restore ecosystem services altered by agriculture. Despite their wide use, little is known about the effects of establishing shelterbelts on soil macro invertebrates, especially earthworms, which are of major importance in soil processes. We assessed earthworm composition, diversity and biomass in three land use systems: native shelterbelts dominated by Acacia and Eucalyptus species, agricultural pastures and native remnant woodland fragments dominated by Eucalyptus blakelyi and/or Eucalyptus melliodora . Earthworm communities differed significantly among systems, with abundance, biomass and diversity greatest under pasture. Within shelterbelts we saw a shift from high earthworm biomass and density to low with increasing time after establishment. Soil edaphic variables did not correlate strongly with earthworm biomass or density, but were correlated with earthworm community composition. Overall the introduction of native woody vegetation was associated with a decline in density and biomass of earthworms, including a decrease in the relative abundance of exotic species. As such shelterbelts can be used to promote native earthworm relative abundance, which may be important for local diversity, soil function and landscape connectivity.

AB  - In many areas of intensive corn production, atrazine and metolachlor are among the most commonly found herbicides in surface and ground water. This 2-yr stud), compared the impact of grass and grass+tree buffer strips on the exported masses of atrazine, metolachlor, and a degradation product of atrazine, desethylatrazine (DEA). The experimental system consisted of four replicate plots in a three-way completely randomized design (no buffer zone, grass buffer zone, and grass+tree buffer strips). The field plots were 5 m wide and 30 m long and grown in corn. The grass and grass+tree buffer strips were 5 m and had the same grass vegetation except for eight young hybrid poplars. Over the 2-yr study, surface runoff and subsurface infiltration water (under the buffer strip) were collected after the initial three rainfall events after herbicide application. Dissolved atrazine, metolachlor, and DEA were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The presence of buffer strips decreased the exported masses of atrazine and metolachlor in surface runoff. A three-way ANOVA with treatment (type of buffer strip), water (surface runoff or subsurface infiltration), and time between herbicide application and rainfall event as factors showed a significant reduction (40-60% in 2004 and 75-95% in 2005) in the total (surface runoff+infiltrated water) exported masses of atrazine and metolachlor in the presence of buffer strips. Rainfall events after herbicide application were different between the 2 yr and greatly affected the flow distribution (e.g., subsurface infiltration) and the leached herbicide concentrations. No significant difference in the capacity to reduce herbicide exports was observed between grass and grass+tree buffer strip treatments; the poorly developed young poplar biomass at the time of the study may partly explain this observation.

AB  - Agricultural practices in the UK have come under increased scrutiny since the heavy and widespread flooding of 2000 and 2001. Although the impact of land use on runoff and flood risk is of growing concern, there are few quantitative data available. A preliminary study was undertaken in the Nant Pontbren catchment, mid-Wales. Experimental tree shelterbelts were established in selected pastures of land used for sheep grazing. Water infiltration rates were up to 60 times higher in areas planted with young trees than in adjacent grazed pastures. This demonstrates that farm trees could represent a key landscape feature, reducing run-off even when only present as a small proportion of the land cover. This is likely to be just one of the environmental and economic benefits of planting trees to re-create a more diverse agricultural landscape.

AB  - 1. Declines in abundance and diversity of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) in Europe have been linked to agricultural intensification and the resulting loss of suitable foraging and nesting habitats. Environmental Stewardship (ES) is a new scheme in England offering the opportunity to restore habitats of value for these important pollinators to agricultural land. Scientific evaluation of the options prescribed within the scheme is essential to ensure that their objectives are met and that the benefits can be realized by the full bumble bee species assemblage. 2. We compared the efficacy of different ES options for field margins on arable land in enhancing the abundance and diversity of flowering resources and foraging bumble bees. Our study was conducted over 3 years using a multisite experiment. 3. Overall, uncropped margins sown with mixtures containing nectar and pollen-producing plants were more effective in providing bumble bee forage than margins sown with a grass mix, allowed to regenerate naturally or managed as conservation headlands. 4. A mixture of agricultural legumes established quickly and attracted on average the highest total abundance and diversity of bumble bees, including the rare long-tongued species Bombus ruderatus and Bombus muscorum. However, marked differences were observed between species and sexes in their responses to field margin management over time. 5. A diverse mixture of native wildflowers attracted more of the shorter-tongued Bombus spp. and provided greater continuity of forage resources, especially early in the season. Allowing Cirsium spp. to flower on such margins also increased their attractiveness to male bumble bees. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the legume-based 'pollen and nectar flower mix', as prescribed under Entry Level Stewardship in England, can quickly provide a highly attractive forage resource for bumble bees, but that issues of seasonal flowering phenology and longevity of the mixture need to be addressed. Establishment of 'floristically enhanced margins' under Higher Level Stewardship will be important to provide diverse perennial communities of forage plants and to support a greater range of Bombus spp. and other pollinators. The population-level responses of bumble bees to introduced seed mixtures and other agri-environment options require further study in order to maximize the benefits of such schemes in intensively farmed landscapes.

AB  - The global decline of insect pollinators, especially bees, is cause for concern, and there is an urgent need for cost-effective conservation measures in agricultural landscapes. While landscape context and habitat quality are known to influence species richness and abundance of bees, there is a lack of evidence from manipulative field experiments on bees' responses to adaptive management across differently structured landscapes. We present the results of a large-scale study that investigated the effects of a targeted agri-environment scheme (AES) on bumble bees (Bombus spp.) over three years in the United Kingdom. Forage patches of different sizes were sown with a conservation flower mixture across eight sites covering a broad range of agricultural land use types. Species richness and worker densities (especially of the longer-tongued Bombus species for which the mixture was targeted) were significantly higher on sown forage patches than on existing non-crop control habitats throughout the three-year study, but the strength of this response depended on both the proportions of arable land and abundance of herbaceous forb species in the surrounding landscape. The size of sown patches also affected worker density, with smaller patches (0.25 ha) attracting higher densities of some species than larger patches (1.0 ha). Our models show that a targeted AES can deliver greater net benefits in more intensively farmed areas, in terms of the number and species richness of bumble bees supported, than in heterogeneous landscapes where other foraging habitats exist. These findings serve to strengthen the evidence base for extending agri-environment schemes to boost declining pollinator populations to a larger number of agricultural landscapes across the globe.

AB  - The value of introduced seed mixtures in providing forage for bumblebees on farmland was assessed by direct observation of individuals and analysis of pollen loads. Two mixtures of perennial grasses and wildflowers were compared with an annual mix of mostly seed-bearing crops over three years. Foraging bees showed contrasting patterns of visitation depending on species. Longer-tongued Bombus species preferred the perennial mixtures in which Trifolium pratense was dominant, whilst shorter-tongued Bombus and honeybees, Apis mellifera, visited mainly Borago officinalis in the annual mix. These patterns were supported by analysis of pollen loads from B. pascuorum and B. terrestris, both species showing a high degree of flower constancy to sown species. The relative specialisation of different bee species towards certain plant families, and the flowering phenology of seed mix components, must be considered in the design of agri-environment measures to conserve these and other pollinators.

AB  - The influence of a hedge surrounding bottomland on soil-water movement along the hillslope was studied on a plot scale for 28 months. The study was based on the comparison of two transects, one with a hedge, the other without, using mainly a dense grid of tensiometers. The influence of the bottomland hedge was located in the area where tree roots were developed, several metres upslope from the hedge, and could be observed both in the saturated and non-saturated zone, from May to December. The hedge induced a high rate of soil drying, because of the high evaporative capacity of the trees. We evaluated that water uptake by the hedge during the growing season was at least 100 mm higher than without a hedge. This increased drying rate led to a delayed rewetting of the soils upslope from the hedge in autumn, of about 1 month compared with the situation without a hedge. Several consequences of this delayed rewetting are expected: a delay in the return of subsurface transfer from the hillslope to the riparian zone, a buffering effect of hedges on floods, already observed at the catchment scale, and an increased residence time of pollutants.

AB  - The groundwater close to a bottomland hedge presented strong vertical and lateral gradients of nitrate and chloride concentrations. The strong transpiration by trees in summer and the dissymmetry of the root development induced persistent high chloride level in depth upslope from the hedge. Nitrate concentration, on the other hand, decreased sharply in the same area, taken up by the vegetation or denitrified by the microorganisms, whose activity was enhanced at the bottom of the hedge. © 2001 Académie des sciences / Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

AB  - Capsule Key marginal habitat features maintain their importance even when they occur at very low density. Aims To assess the importance for breeding birds of key habitat elements, such as isolated shrubs, hedgerows and untilled vegetation patches. MethodsWe investigated the habitat preferences of Red-backed Shrikes Lanius collurio in an agricultural environment where key habitat elements have been dramatically reduced. Based upon data from territorial maps, a fine-scale model of habitat preference was developed and the results of three different analytical approaches (binary logistic regression, multimodel inference and hierarchical partitioning) were compared. Results The occurrence of Red-backed Shrikes was positively influenced by the extent of non-grazed/mown grassland, isolated bushes and hedgerows, and negatively influenced by woodland cover. The model highlighted the importance of bushes/hedgerows despite their very scarce occurrence in the study areas (overall, average cover only 7.94%). Breeding densities were rather low, but mean densities were slightly higher in pasture zones in which bushes/hedgerows availability was higher than elsewhere. Conclusion These results confirm the crucial importance of these key marginal elements even in depauperated farmland landscapes. Maintaining and increasing their availability is a key management option for the encouragement of breeding Red-backed Shrikes, and potentially for other species which are also declining in these farmland habitats. © 2012 British Trust for Ornithology.

AB  - Uncultivated riparian areas can play an important role in reducing nutrient loading to streams in agricultural watersheds. Groundwater flow and geochemistry were monitored in the riparian zone of a small agricultural watershed in southern Ontario. Hydraulic and geochemical measurements were taken along a transect of monitoring wells extending across the riparian area into an agricultural field. Chloride and nitrate concentrations in groundwater samples collected from the agricultural field were much higher than in samples from the riparian area. A sharp decline in both nitrate and chloride concentrations was observed near the field-riparian zone boundary. It appears that increased recharge within the riparian zone, as compared to the artificially drained field, caused nitrate-rich groundwater from the field to be diverted downward beneath the riparian zone, thus limiting the input of agrochemicals to the riparian area and consequently protecting the stream from potential contamination. Geochemical data also indicated that nitrate was attenuated in the downward moving groundwater. Patterns of dissolved oxygen concentrations and redox potential in the subsurface coincided with the pattern defined by groundwater nitrate. These patterns indicated that conditions within the riparian zone and at depth near the field-riparian zone boundary were conducive to denitrification. A Linear relation between the delta(15)N and delta(18)O values of nitrate from the monitored transect also supported denitrification as the primary nitrate removal mechanism. This study provides a new conceptual model of how riparian zones may prevent nitrate contamination of streams, and highlights the need for a complete understanding of both groundwater flow and geochemistry in riparian environments.

AB  - The practice of continuously grazing cattle along streams has caused extensive degradation of riparian habitats. Buffer strips and managed intensive rotational grazing (MIRG) have been proposed to protect and restore stream ecosystems in Wisconsin. However, the ecological implications of a switch from traditional livestock management to MIRG or buffer strip establishment have not been investigated. Differences in small mammal communities associated with riparian areas on continuously grazed and MIRG pastures, as well as vegetative buffer strips adjacent to raw crops, were investigated in southwestern Wisconsin during May-September 1997 and 1998. More species (mean of 6-7) were found on the buffer sites than on the pasture sites (mean of 2-5). Total small mammal abundance on buffer sites was greater than on the pastures as well; there were 3-5 times as many animals on the buffer sites compared to the pasture sites, depending on year. There were no differences in species richness or total abundance between MIRG and continuously grazed pastures in either year. Total small mammal abundance was greater near the stream than away from the stream, regardless of farm management practice but there were no differences in species richness. Buffer strips appear to support a particularly rich and abundant small mammal community. Although results did not detect a difference in small mammal use between pasture types, farm-wide implications of a conversion from continuous to MIRG styles of grazing may benefit small mammals indirectly by causing an increase in the prevalence of pasture in the agricultural landscape.

AB  - Vegetative filter strips (VFS) have been shown to have high potential for reducing nonpoint source pollution from cultivated agricultural source areas, but information from uncultivated source areas amended with poultry litter is limited Simulated rainfall was used in analyzing effects of VFS length (0, 3.1, 6.1, 9.2, 15.2, and 21.4 m) on quality of runoff from fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) plots (1.5 x 24.4 m) amended with poultry litter (5 Mg/ha). The VFS reduced mass transport of ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N), total KjeEdahl nitrogen (TKN), ortho-phosphorus (PO4-P), total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (GOD), and total suspended solids (TSS). Mass transport of TKN, NH3-N, TP, and PO4-P were reduced by averages of 39, 47, 40, and 39%, respectively, by 3.1 m VFS and by 81, 98, 91, and 90%, respectively, by 21.4 m VFS. Effectiveness of VFS in terms of mass transport reduction was unchanged, however, beyond 3.1 m length for TSS and COD and averaged 35 and 51%, respectively. The VFS were ineffective in removing nitrate-nitrogen from the incoming runoff. Removal of litter constituents was described very well (r(2) = 0.70 to 0.94) by a first-order relationship between constituent removal and VFS length.

AB  - Characterizing the spatial and temporal variability of small scale runoff responses is essential to distributed hydrologic modeling. To explore the variability of runoff responses, we analyzed surface runoff hydrographs from 12 neighboring hillslopes in central Iowa, USA that were observed for 72 runoff events over a four-year period. These agricultural experimental hillslopes receive various prairie filter strip treatments and drain areas ranging from 0.48 to 3.19 ha. The distances between them vary from tens of meters to about 3 km. We compared the hydrographs from the remaining 11 hillslopes to the hydrograph at the benchmark hillslope (i.e., hillslope B6 with no treatment). The results showed that: (I) for any individual event in which noticeable surface runoff occurred, the hydrographs from these hillslopes had similar shapes but different magnitudes; (2) for any paired hillslopes, the shape similarity persisted, but the scaling factor (the regression slope between two flow series) changed across events; and (3) for any runoff event, no simple relationship exists between the spatial variation of the scaling factor and the slope, slope length, area, and prairie strip width at the footslope of the hillslopes. Interestingly, we found that for 9 out of the 11 paired hillslopes, 40-70% of the temporal variation in the scaling factors can be explained by the antecedent wetness condition and the maximum hourly rain accumulation. These results suggest that the small-scale surface runoff responses are spatially variable but organized linearly, i.e., shape similarity (or linearity) in space is another feature of the small-scale runoff process. This phenomenon seems to result from the spatial vicinity and small-scale spatial variability of rainfall intensity and antecedent soil moisture. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Shelterbelts that were created in place of meadow and meadow-steppe landscapes of the forest-steppe zone of northern continents serve as areas of carbon accumulation and participate in the formation of soil organic matter. In the Great Plains of the United States (in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska) and on the Central Russian Upland (Belgorod, Voronezh, and Kursk oblasts), a general tendency toward an increase in the Corg pool in the topsoil (0–30 cm) from the marginal parts of the shelterbelts toward their central parts by about 3.5–10.0 t per each 10 m has been identified. In 55 years of the existence of shelterbelts on chernozems in the European part of Russia, the mean annual rate of the organic carbon accumulation in the upper meter has been varying within 0.7–1.5 t/ha. In 19 years of the existence of a shelterbelt in the area of Huron (South Dakota), the mean annual rate of the organic carbon accumulation in the 1-m-thick layer of the Bonilla soil series (Haplustolls) has reached 1.9 t/ha. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Within the Southeastern (SE) Coastal Plain of the U.S., numerous freshwaters and estuaries experience eutrophication with significant nutrient contributions by agricultural non-point sources (NPS). Riparian buffers are often used to reduce agricultural NPS yet the effect of buffers in the watershed is difficult to quantify. Using corrected Akaike information criterion (AIC(c)) and model averaging, we compared flow-path riparian buffer models with land use/land cover (LULC) models in 24 watersheds from the SE Coastal Plain to determine the ability of riparian buffers to reduce or mitigate stream total nitrogen concentrations (TNC). Additional models considered the relative importance of headwaters and artificial agricultural drainage in the Coastal Plain. A buffer model which included cropland and non-buffered cropland best explained stream TNC (R (2) = 0.75) and was five times more likely to be the correct model than the LULC model. The model average predicted that current buffers removed 52 % of nitrogen from the edge-of-field and 45 % of potential nitrogen from the average SE Coastal Plain watershed. On average, 26 % of stream nitrogen leaked through buffered cropland. Our study suggests that stream TNC could potentially be reduced by 34 % if buffers were adequately restored on all cropland. Such estimates provide realistic expectations of nitrogen removal via buffers to watershed managers as they attempt to meet water quality goals. In addition, model comparisons of AIC(c) values indicated that non-headwater buffers may contribute little to stream TNC. Model comparisons also indicated that artificial drainage should be considered when accessing buffers and stream nitrogen.

AB  - Veterinary antibiotics (VAs) such as oxytetracycline (OTC), sulfadimethoxine (SDT) and sulfamethazine (SMZ) may adversely impact human health and environmental quality. Understanding sorption and transport of VAs is important for assessing the risk of VAs reaching surface or groundwater resources. Vegetative buffer strips (VBS) affect soil properties that enhance removal of organic pollutants and thus may be a useful tool for mitigating veterinary antibiotic transport from agricultural lands. Therefore, the objectives of this study were: (1) measure the sorption and retention of veterinary antibiotics to soils collected from three different soils series each planted to agroforestry buffer (AGF), grass buffer (GBS), and row crops (RC), and determine the soil physical and chemical properties governing antibiotic sorption to these soils; (2) investigate changes in VA sorption and retention to VBS and cropland soils in the presence of manure-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM); (3) and study and model VA transport through soil columns repacked with VBS and cropland soils in presence and absence of manure-derived DOM. Sorption experiment results show that OTC was strongly adsorbed by all soils and was not readily extractable, whereas SDT and SMZ sorption to soils were weak and therefore highly mobile in soils. The sorption isotherms for OTC and SMZ were well fitted by the Freundlich isotherm model. Further investigation of solid-to-solution partition coefficients ( Kd ) revealed that vegetative management had a significant (P < 0.01) influence on SMZ sorption and followed the order AGF > GBS > RC, and for OTC sorption VBS > RC. Significant differences in Kd values for these VAs were also noted among the soil series studied. Linear regression analyses indicate that clay content and pH were the most important soil properties controlling OTC and SDT adsorption, respectively. For SMZ, organic carbon content, pH, initial SMZ concentration, and clay content were the most important factors controlling sorption. Study of the two most contrasting soils revealed that increasing solution pH from 6.0 to 7.5 greatly reduced SMZ sorption to the Armstrong GBS soil, but little pH effect was observed for the Huntington GBS soil. Although the presence of DOM (150 mg L -1 C) had little effect on Freundlich model parameters, DOM resulted in slightly lower SMZ Kd values, presumably, due to competitive interactions between the VA and DOM for sorption sites. Transport study including 14 C-labeled SMZ or SMZ plus DOM (150 mg L-1 OC) and non-reactive tracer bromide was conducted in saturated columns packed with Huntington soil (silt loam) planted to AGF and RC. Bromide breakthrough curves were fitted with an equilibrium model within the CXTFIT software, whereas SMZ breakthrough was fitted with the HYDRUS-1D software using two-site and three-site models with linear or Freundlich sorption components. Results indicate that the three-site model containing two reversible sites and one irreversible site coupled with the Freundlich sorption component (3S2R-Freu-irrev model) best describes SMZ transport through the columns with model efficiencies of 0.998, 0.994, and 0.991 for AGF, AGF + DOM and cropland soils, respectively. Fitted sorption parameters such as Kd , Kf and N are in the same range of those obtained from equilibrium sorption experiments. DOM effects were not observed due to diluted DOM concentration. Data from equilibrium sorption experiments and column transport experiments suggest that the AGF soil has a larger capacity to retain SMZ than the cropland soil. Overall, this research facilitates our understanding of VA sorption and transport in the environment and supports the use of vegetative buffers to mitigate VA loss from agroecosystems.

AB  - One-half of a 35- by 250-m riparian buffer cropped in corn (Zea mays L.) was seeded with fine leaf fescue (Festuca spp.) and allowed to remain idle to determine water quality changes resulting from riparian buffer restoration. A corn control was also used in this paired watershed design located in Connecticut. Water, N, and P fluxes were determined for precipitation, overland now, and ground water. Also, an N mass balance was calculated. Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations significantly (P < 0.05) increased as ground water flowed through the restored buffer. Nitrate N (NO3-N) concentrations declined significantly but most (52%) of the decrease occurred within a 2.5-m wetland adjacent to the stream. An N mass balance for the 2.5-m strip indicated that denitrification only accounted for 1% of the N losses and plant uptake was from 7 to 13% of the N losses annually. Ground water was the dominant source of N to the buffer and also the dominant loss. Restoration of the riparian buffer decreased (p < 0.05) overland flow concentrations of TKN by 70%, NO3-N by 83%, TP by 73%, and total suspended solids (TSS) by 92% as compared with the control. Restoration reduced (p < 0.05) NO3-N concentrations in ground water by 35% as compared with the control. Underestimated denitrification and dilution by upwelling ground water in the wetland area adjacent to the stream were believed to be primarily responsible for the decreasing NO3-N concentrations observed.

AB  - 1. Agriculture, urbanization or forestry in river catchments can influence river organisms through diffuse effects on hydrology and hydrochemistry, or local effects on habitat character, bank erosion and sediment delivery. Riparian buffer zones are sometimes established to mitigate undesirable effects on salmonids, but consequences for organisms such as macroinvertebrates are less well known. 2. Riparian fencing and tree coppicing were carried out on upland tributaries of the Welsh River Wye (UK) from 1997 onwards with the aim of enhancing conditions for salmonid fish. The present study used routine, agency monitoring data to compare assemblages in three recently managed streams and five adjacent control streams. Data between 1995 and 2004 were used to assess treatment effects through time. 3. Post-treatment (2000-2004) assemblages were richer in recently managed streams than in controls, mostly due to apparent gains of taxa typical of channel margins and lowland, warmer conditions. However, results were equivocal because invertebrate families typical of lowland, more eutrophic conditions increased in occurrence in all reaches irrespective of treatment, while overall richness declined. 4. This study illustrates how routine monitoring data can reveal some effects of riparian land-use and management on stream biota. However, improved experimental design, ideally using a before after control intervention approach, would have allowed more effective assessment in this case study where confounding trends were so marked. We advocate using such approaches in future restoration studies to allow stronger inference and greater statistical power. The recent general decline in the richness of typical headwater organisms in the Wye system requires investigation. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - 1. The restoration of degraded riparian zones to improve a range of functions is attracting increasing interest, but there are still questions about (i) how effectively restoration changes riparian or channel conditions; (ii) whether riparian management offsets the effects of wider catchment pressures; and (iii) whether these effects can be detected quantitatively. 2. A catchment-scale experiment was used to assess the effects of riparian restoration on riparian and channel conditions in the Welsh River Wye. In a hierarchically designed survey, variations in river habitat character were assessed among tributaries where riparian zones were recently managed for restoration (n = 9 streams), unmanaged controls (n = 12), intensively grazed pastures (n = 3) and coniferous plantation (n = 3). Management between 1997 and 2003, largely involving coppicing, was designed to exclude grazing through fencing in order to enable vegetation development while creating salmonid refuges. River habitat character was assessed using the UK 'River Habitat Survey' (RHS) method, with habitat variation quantified using Principal Components Analysis. 3. Stream habitats varied significantly among treatment categories. Streams draining plantation conifer had 'harder' channel features, while those draining intensively grazed pasture were characterized by finer substrata and more active channels than elsewhere. Riparian management reduced livestock trampling ( = poaching) and increased algal cover relative to controls. Coppicing and riparian fencing successfully excluded grazing on banks while increasing, in-stream vegetation cover, but did not affect substrata, flow-types and channel features. 4. These data show that RHS can detect habitat variation among streams in contrasting riparian land-use, revealing some apparently significant effects of recent restoration. We advocate longer-term investigations at reach to catchment scales to assess longer-term effects on channel and flow character, and to appraise fully the extent to which local riparian management can offset impairments at a catchment or larger scale, such as altered run-off regimes, sediment delivery and climate change.

AB  - The use of riparian buffer strips as a means of reducing diffuse pollution in European grassland systems is becoming more common and consequently there is a need for comprehensive research on the influence of buffer strip management, placement and structure on biodiversity. Carabid assemblages were examined in a range of riparian zones in intensively managed grassland in Scotland. Carabids were monitored by pitfall trapping in riparian zones open to grazing, wide riparian buffer strips (> 5 m wide), narrow boundary strips (< 2 m wide) and adjacent fields in order to determine factors influencing carabid diversity and assemblage structure. While carabid diversity was greater in open riparian zones and narrow boundary strips when compared to the adjacent fields, it was actually poorer in wide riparian buffers when compared to open zones thus indicating wide buffers may actually be detrimental to carabid diversity. Carabid assemblages in wide riparian buffers were, however, more distinct from the adjacent field than narrow boundary strips or riparian zones open to grazing. Consequently, while the presence of wide riparian buffers may not promote carabid diversity within the actual buffer strips, by adding an additional habitat that supports a distinct carabid assemblage, riparian buffer strips may promote diversity at the landscape level. Carabid assemblage structure was driven by a combination of soil and vegetation characteristics in addition to physical attributes including distance from the watercourse and width of the strip. Only when we have a better understanding of the factors influencing biodiversity within riparian buffer strips can we start to formulate effective management prescriptions that fuse their dual function of pollution mitigation and biodiversity promotion.

AB  - There is growing evidence that insect pollinators are declining globally and agricultural intensification has been identified as a major cause of this decline. To determine how pollinators utilise different habitats within an intensive grassland landscape, bumblebees and butterflies were monitored across a range of agricultural and semi-natural habitats using standardised transect walks. Few pollinators were recorded in intensively managed arable and grassland fields indicating that such habitats provided poor foraging resources. Hedgerows also yielded few pollinators reflecting the lack of pollen and nectar bearing plant species within hedgerows in this landscape. The highest density of pollinators, and richest pollinator assemblages, were recorded in open scrub, road verges and riparian buffer strips. This was most likely the result of such habitats supporting a diverse array of flowering plant species which in turn provided foraging opportunities for pollinators. These prime pollinator habitats should be managed to ensure that they maintain rich botanical assemblages and thus to ensure a continuous supply of nectar and pollen throughout the season.

AB  - In New Zealand, around half of the lowland water bod-ies do not meet water quality standards, primarily due to widespread changes in land use. Riparian restoration has been occurring in New Zealand for over 30 years in an effort to minimize this impact, however, little monitor-ing of restoration effectiveness has been undertaken. This study evaluated the impact of riparian plantings on water quality of lowland streams in the Lake Ellesmere catch-ment. A paired-catchment design on four river reaches was used to compare restored riparian buffers with con-trol sites upstream. Chemical water quality sampling was used in conjunction with a macroinvertebrate community assessment. Equivocal benefits of riparian restoration were observed, with improvements in some variables but not in others. Riparian restoration had a positive effect on water quality in terms of increasing dissolved oxygen and decreasing turbidity. However, conductivity increased at planted sites and no changes were observed in other vari-ables. These findings may be affected by the insufficient width of all four buffers, and gaps in the buffer sys-tem contributing to poor water quality. Although variable responses were seen in invertebrate community composi-tion, this research suggests that even narrow planted buffer strips may be effective in improving some water qual-ity parameters. The overall mixed results present a fair assessment of the benefits of riparian restoration that may be expected within a relatively short time following veg-etation establishment. Even when no baseline data have been established prior to restoration, this research showed monitoring can demonstrate the effectiveness of riparian restoration.

AB  - Overwintering polyphagous predator density and composition was compared within a mid-field overwintering refuge ('beetle bank') and two conventional hedgebanks over a 5-year period. During the study predator densities in the beetle bank were similar to or greater than those in the conventional hedgebanks. Whilst predator densities remained relatively stable in both of the hedgebanks over time, densities fluctuated significantly within the beetle bank. Many of the species recorded on the beetle bank are considered to be important predators of cereal aphids. The results are discussed in terms of the implications of creating such a habitat for the biological control of cereal aphids.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to investigate the suitability for overwintering of polyphagous arthropods of five different grass species (Arrhenatherum elatius, Dactylis glomerata, Phleum pratense, Festuca rubra and Cynosurus cristatus) and a natural regeneration treatment on mid-field overwintering refuges (beetle banks). Polyphagous predator density and composition differed significantly between the six treatments with A. elatius and D. glomerata supporting the highest predator densities and C. cristatus and the treatments left to regenerate naturally having the lowest. The results are discussed in terms of species composition within the different treatments, cost of creating a beetle bank, and the implications for the biological control of cereal aphids.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to investigate whether polyphagous predators dispersing from a within field overwintering refuge ('beetle bank') could reduce cereal aphid numbers in an adjacent crop of winter wheat. To assess the impact of predators enidgrating from the beetle bank on populations of Sitobion avenae in the crop, polyphagous predator densities were manipulated using exclusion barriers placed at set distances away from the beetle bank. Results from the pitfall trap data indicated that the exclusion barriers were effective in significantly reducing the number of 'boundary' Carabidae, 'open-field' Carabidae, Staphylinidae, Linyphiidae and Lycosidae in the enclosed areas compared to the control areas by 56, 31, 46, 24 and 57%, respectively. Aphid numbers were significantly greater in the enclosures, where they were 34% higher compared to the control areas during the aphid peak. The impact of polyphagous predation decreased with increasing distance away from the beetle bank and the distribution of polyphagous predators in relation to the beetle bank varied over time. The results are discussed in terms of the peak activity periods of the different predatory groups and the consequences for integrated crop management (ICM). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - A series of field experiments assessed the ability of sloping (8degrees) 5-m-long by 2-m-wide grass buffer strips to trap the faecal microbes Escherichia coli and Campylobacter. The microbes, applied within dairy-farm effluent, were washed into the strips by surface runoff generated at rates of 4-13 litres/min using a water sprinkler system. The effluent and surface and subsurface outflows at the lower end of each plot were sampled for microbial analysis. Flow rate influenced the timing of peak microbial concentration in outflow and the recovery of both microbes. Under high flow, recovery rates varied from 15-100%, and hence entrapment was often minimal. Under the slowest rate of water application, entrapment was much greater (greater than or equal to95%), at least over the 40 min of water application. During large runoff events, and where preferential flowpaths occur, buffer strips need to exceed 5 m in length in order to markedly reduce the delivery of faecal microbes to waterways. Of those microbes trapped in the grass strips under fast flow rates, some were remobilised and washed out following a subsequent runoff event, 5 days later. On occasion, a considerable volume of flow was observed to bypass beneath the subsurface collecting troughs, probably reducing the effectiveness of the buffer strips.

AB  - Avian communities can benefit from reconstructed herbaceous, strip habitats among agriculture; however, any benefits may be limited by width-dependent factors such as edge effects. We used 2 years of strip-transect surveys to evaluate avian density, richness, and conservation value between non-, narrow (mean width 8.2 m). and wide (mean width = 40.7 m) field borders on intensive row-cropped field margins in the agriculture dominated Mississippi Alluvial Valley, Wide field borders supported two times more birds (7.0 birds/0.2 ha) than narrow borders [3.6 birds/ 0.2 ha), which supported six times more birds than no border (0.6 birds/0.2 ha). Mean bird species richness was over five times greater in bordered (0.80-1.10 species/0.2 ha) than non-bordered margins (0.14 species/0.2 ha) but was largely uninfluenced by border width. We documented more bird use of agricultural fields and wooded fencerows adjacent to bordered than non-bordered margins. Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and Dickcissels (Spiza americana) had the strongest positive response to field border presence and width. Wide borders attracted high densities (2.0 birds/0.2 ha) of Dickcissels, an edge-sensitive species, suggesting the conservation potential of herbaceous vegetation patches <50 m of wooded edges for grassland birds, Extensive implementation of field borders, particularly of enhanced width, may contribute substantially to grassland bird conservation strategies m intensive, agricultural landscapes, although confirmation of these benefits requires additional demographic information.

AB  - Abstract: Nest density and survival of two farmland birds (dickcissel, Spiza americana and red-winged blackbird, Agelaius phoeniceus) were evaluated in four early-succession conservation practices: (1) large forest block [6–8 year old trees], (2) riparian forest buffer [1–3 year old trees], (3) monotypic switchgrass [Panicum virgatum] buffer [no trees], and (4) diverse forb-native grass buffer [no trees] over three years (2005–2007). We modeled daily survival of dickcissel (n =733) and red-winged blackbird (n =414) nests as a function of nest-site, patch, and landscape covariates. Dickcissels nested in greater densities (3.5 times) in large blocks than any buffers, and of non-wooded buffers, they preferred those with diverse vegetation. Dickcissels largely nested in buffers only early in the season. Dickcissel nest success was 22.9% on average and was similar among conservation practices except riparian forest buffers, in which they apparently suffered from high densities of red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) and low vegetative cover. Dickcissel nest success related positively to nest height, but negatively to grass cover, horizontal vegetation density, and proximity (<30m) to row-crop fields. Red-winged blackbirds had low overall nest success (8.6%) across conservation practices, though substantially higher for nests in diverse forb-native grass buffers (23.4%).

AB  - Upland habitat buffers (i.e., strips of noncrop, herbaceous vegetation) that are established adjacent to wooded fencerows offer landowners an economical option to provide wildlife benefits within intensive agricultural landscapes. However, being located near a wooded edge may increase grassland bird vulnerability to edge effects through reduced nest survival. We examined nesting bird communities in field margins adjacent to wooded field edges with no buffer (i.e., control), narrow (approx. 10-m) buffers, and wide (approx. 30-m) buffers in an intensive agricultural system in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley, United States. Dickcissel (Spiza americana) and red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) accounted for 97% of nests. Nest density was >7 times greater in wide buffers than in narrow. We modeled nest survival in Program MARK as a function of time (yr and season), nest-site, and local vegetation characteristics. Nest survival was influenced by among- and within-season temporal effects and local vegetation structure, but not by buffer width. Nest success varied substantially between years and within seasons for dickcissel (12.9% and 19.1% early in the seasons of 2003 and 2004, respectively), but not for red-winged blackbird (15.1%). Overall nest-success estimates were similar to noncrop, herbaceous strips elsewhere in the United States, though whether or not these estimates represent population sinks remains uncertain. Based on this research, we advocate integrating upland habitat buffers within intensive agricultural landscapes and emphasize the use of wide buffers when grassland-nesting birds are a conservation priority.

AB  - Creating and restoring patches of noncrop early-succession vegetation within agricultural landscapes may mitigate grassland bird population declines caused by agricultural land use and intensification. Achieving this goal requires an ability to balance avian benefits with agronomics, which may be facilitated by understanding how bird communities respond to various conservation practices. We evaluated bird richness, abundance, Shannon diversity, and Total Avian Conservation Value in 20 replicates of four Conservation Reserve Program practices in an intensive rowcrop agricultural landscape in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley from May-Jul., 2005-2007. Conservation practices included: (1) large blocks of structurally-diverse early-succession vegetation (6-8 y old trees) and three buffer types; (2) 30 m wide monotypic filter strips with tall dense switchgrass (Panicum virgatum); (3) 30 m wide diverse filter strips with a forb-native warm season grass mixture; and (4) 60 m wide early-succession riparian forest buffers (1-3 y old trees). The breeding bird community was dominated by red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus; 43% of total) and dickcissels (Spiza americana; 42% of total) but commonly included eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea), mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). We observed >= 1.8 X more dickcissels in large blocks and diverse filter strips than other buffers and greater Shannon diversity in large blocks than any buffers (P < 0.05). Diverse filter strips had >= 1.6 X greater overall bird density (7.2 birds/0.6 ha), on average, than all other practices. Based on these data, we conclude that buffers are attractive to farmland breeding birds and may provide important ecological benefits to supplement a conservation management system founded on large blocks of early-succession vegetation.

AB  - 1 Samples from 32 hedgerows (c. 6 m wide, with full-grown trees) in central New York included 39 forest herb taxa, comprising nearly 70% of the forest herb taxa found in adjacent forest samples. 2 We sampled three types of hedgerow. Two types were attached to forest: remnant hedgerows (n = 14), and regenerated hedgerows (n = 11) that had grown up spontaneously between open fields in the last 50 years. There were no significant differences between remnant and regenerated hedgerows in the richness or abundance of forest herbs, presumably indicating colonization of regenerated hedgerows. Such colonization implies that hedgerows serve a corridor function. 3 The species composition of forest herbs in hedgerows attached to forest stands showed a strong affinity with that of the adjacent stand, both for remnant and regenerated hedgerows. 4 There was a distance effect within hedgerows. Richness of forest herbs and similarity of composition to forest declined with distance along the hedgerow from forest, implying colonization from the adjacent attached stand. 5 The third type of hedgerow sampled, isolated remnants (n = 7), was not lower in richness or abundance of forest herbs than hedgerows attached to forest.

AB  - Abstract: Surveys were performed along paired transects running from the boundary to the field core and with and without sown grass strips. Their presence affected weed assemblages in the boundaries and over the first metre of the field margins as well as the patterns of weed species distribution. Sown grass strip effect always significantly explained the weed species assemblage in boundaries (23.6%), crop edges (28.4%) and field margins (8.1%) but not in field cores. Sown grass strips enlarged the habitat of boundary species (Plantago lanceolata, Arrhenatherum elatius, Carex sp.). They limited the spread of some species into the field (e.g. Sonchus asper, Anagallis arvensis). Some species were favoured by the establishment of sown grass strips (e.g. Cirsium arvense, Bromus sp., Elytrigia repens). However, sown grass strips acted as a buffer zone for arable species (Alopecurus myosuroides, Viola tricolor, Capsella bursa-pastoris), preventing them to extend their habitat from the fields to the boundaries. With short-term consideration, the establishment of sown grass strips puts areas of arable land aside, but offers an opportunity for many plant species to enlarge their habitat without increasing weediness.

AB  - C ordeau S , P etit S , R eboud X & C hauvel B (2011). Sown grass strips harbour high weed diversity but decrease weed richness in adjacent crops. Weed Research 52, 88-97. Summary Sown grass strips have been widely established on field margins across France, because of their expected environmental benefits. They may also enhance the diversity of plant species in the adjacent boundary by buffering them from agricultural practices. However, the strips could act as an extended reservoir for weeds and increase their dispersal into the field. This study evaluated the impact of a 5-m-wide sown grass strip on (i) the weed richness, abundance and diversity of both boundary and field adjacent habitats and on (ii) the width of the edge zone within the field, defined as the zone where boundary habitats impact the flora in the field. We surveyed the flora in 10 fields along continuous transects running from the boundary toward the centre of the field on opposite sides of each field, one side with a sown grass strip and one side without. The establishment of sown grass strips did not change the overall species richness at the field scale, but modified its distribution in the different habitats. In the boundaries, plant species richness, total abundance or diversity (Shannon index) remained unchanged when a sown grass strip was present, whereas these indicators sharply decreased in the crop edge (−10.9 species and −86.4 individuals per 1.25 m2) and in the field margin (−3.6 species and −9.6 individuals per 1.25 m2) where the grass strip was present. Sown grass strips also significantly decreased the width of the edge zone, from 6.5 to 1.5 m for species richness and from 12 to 1 m for species diversity, demonstrating a decrease in weed ingress into the crop.

AB  - 1.Understanding the mechanisms by which environmental change has impacted natural processes typically requires good time series for the environmental change. Unfortunately, other than for climate, detailed time series of historical environments are scarce. In many instances, researchers can only collate disparate and sometimes fragmented information from the literature or from historical or pre-historical sources. 2.Here, we apply modern statistical methods to reconstruct a recent historical time series of environmental change from sparse data collected from heterogeneous sources. Specifically, we deal with record irregularity and the varying levels of uncertainty associated with each datum using state-space models in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. 3.As an example, we reconstruct a time series of a simple landscape feature (hedgerow length) over a large spatial scale (Britain) over a long-time period (50years), by combining both stock estimates and rate of change estimates, gathered from different historical sources. 4.We illustrate the utility of the method by relating the population trends of a hedgerow-nesting passerine bird, the yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella to the reconstructed trends in hedgerow length. Population density was closely related to hedgerow availability, suggesting a potential key role for nesting habitat loss in the yellowhammer decline. 5.The modelling framework we used is flexible and general. The method can be adapted to reconstruct time series of any environmental variables from a variety of sparse and heterogeneous historical sources. © 2010 British Ecological Society.

AB  - Riparian buffer strips are managed for the enhancement of water quality through control of non point source pollution.Denitrification in riparian buffer strips is thought to be the major process -with nitrate uptake by plant growth- that reduces nitrate input in surface water. We investigated the Denitrifier Enzyme Activity (DEA) to test how the buffer strip management modifies the denitrification process. The experimental site is composed of a crop field and a 11 m wide grassed buffer strip at the border between the crop field and a tributary to the Attert river, South-East Belgium. Soil samples from the crop field and the buffer strip have been submitted to different imposed conditions combining glucose, nitrate and water saturation to investigate how antecedent water regime, nitrate and carbon content affect denitrification.The work included DEA measurements on undisturbed soil cores freshly sampled. Experiments on undisturbed soil cores identify the buffer strip as more effective in denitrification (p < 0.001) than the cropped field. However, experiments on samples conditioned under imposed carbon and/or nitrate contents emphasised the importance of micro-topography.

AB  - Reconstructing prairie vegetation in row crop-dominated agricultural landscapes may contribute to several ecosystem services, including the biological control of insect pests, such as the soybean aphid Aphis glycines Matsumura. The influence of the amount and configuration of reconstructed prairie vegetation on the delivery of ecosystem services was investigated in several small catchments at Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge in Iowa. Treatments include catchments entirely in row crops under a no-till, corn-soybean (Zea mays L.-Glycine max [L.] Merrill) rotation, catchments with 10% of the land in prairie located at the base, and catchments with 10 or 20% of the land in multiple contour strips of prairie. During 2009 and 2011 growing seasons, we measured abundance and diversity of aphidophagous insect predators in response to treatment and habitat type (i.e., soybean, prairie). In 2011, we further studied the biological control of soybean aphids by artificially infesting uncaged and caged plants to prevent exposure from predators. While aphidophagous predators were more abundant in prairie, populations of key aphid predators did not significantly differ among treatments. Biological control of the soybean aphid did not differ among treatments or with distance from prairie. Our results suggest that prairie strips, in addition to providing soil and water quality benefits, may increase the populations of beneficial insects, but may not directly impact biocontrol. We propose several hypotheses to explain why we did not observe more soybean aphid predation with the increased abundance of aphidophagous predators in catchments containing prairie.

AB  - Six years of point count data in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa, USA, were used to investigate how the community structure of grassland birds and the densities of four focal species (common yellowthroat, dickcissel, grasshopper sparrow and sedge wren) varied on conservation lands with differing management strategies (i.e., warm- versus cool-season grasses and low- to high-diversity plantings), and between conservation and unmanaged marginal grasslands (e.g., field borders and terraces). Model-selection results indicated that grasshopper sparrow and dickcissel densities were influenced by grassland type, with higher densities in parcels dominated by warm-season grasses. Species-specific changes in density in response to planting diversity reinforced the value of creating heterogeneous habitat for grassland birds. Densities for all four species were substantially lower in unmanaged marginal grasslands versus conservation parcels and the community structure between the two habitats differed significantly, with generalist species (e.g., American robins, common grackles and grassland species associated with shorter, sparse and patchy vegetation (e.g., horned lark and vesper sparrow)) largely replacing tallgrass specialists in unmanaged marginal grassland parcels.

AB  - Adding carbon-rich materials to fields, like manure, may enhance denitrification. Grass filters, which are used to trap surface runoff from these fields, may also provide a carbon-rich environment that favors water infiltration and denitrification. Nitrous oxide (N2O) may be evolved in these settings. It is a radiatively important trace gas and intermediate in the denitrification pathway and several other microbial processes. We measured N2O flux, after simulated rain, using a soil cover technique in poultry-manured plots and grass filters receiving their runoff. Intact soil cores were used to relate the N2O flux to the denitrification potential of the plots. Nitrous oxide fluxes were smaller in grass filters than in manured plots, even though more denitrifying bacteria were present. The average N2O flux in the three most dynamic erosion plots was 755 mug N2O-N m-2h-1, which was 39% of the maximal denitrification rate measured in acetylene-blocked, NO3--amended soil cores. Nitrous oxide flux immediately after rainfall was greater than N2O flux measurements reported for similar agricultural settings.

AB  - Poultry production is increasing in Kentucky. The wastes produced are typically added to soil but surface runoff from agricultural soils treated with poultry waste may exceed water quality standards for fecal indicator bacteria and contribute to agricultural nonpoint-source pollution. While soil erosion in surface runoff is frequently managed by grass filter strips, this management practice may not be an equally effective control for fecal bacteria. We measured soil and fecal coliform trapping in surface runoff from two poultry manure-amended plots in a simulated rain study. The simulation reflected a worst-case event in which poultry waste application was followed by high intensity rain. Grass filter strips, 9 meters long, trapped more than 99% of the soil in surface runoff but fecal coliform trapping was less effective. The efficiency of fecal coliform removal from surface runoff was 74% and 43% in the two plots studied. Fecal coliforms in surface runoff always exceeded primary contact water standards of 200 fecal coliforms/100 ml. These data indicated that grass filter strips which adequately controlled sediment runoff were inadequate to bring surface water contaminated with fecal bacteria into compliance with current primary water contact standards.

AB  - Land application of poultry wastes in Kentucky will increase as the broiler industry grows. If poultry manure stimulates N2O loss from soil it will reduce the fertilizer N value of this waste. In contrast, stimulated N2O loss in grass filter strips receiving the runoff from manured fields could help reduce contamination of surface water by NO3-. Our objectives were to determine (i)if poultry manure stimulated N2O loss in soil after rainfall and (ii) if there was an edge-of-field effect on N2O loss in grass filters intercepting runoff from amended soil. Soil covers were used to measure N2O loss from a well-drained, poultry manure-amended, silt loam soil immediately after simulated rainfall and were also used to measure N2O loss from grass filters intercepting their surface runoff. Nitrous oxide loss from manure-amended soil was greater than from unamended controls and ranged from 5 to 13 mg N2O-N m(-2) h(-1). The maximum N2O loss was equivalent to 3.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1) d(-1). Nitrous oxide loss from grass filters intercepting runoff ranged from 0.1 to 1.4 mg N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) and was significantly greater than portions of the grass filters that did not intercept runoff. Nitrous oxide loss from poultry manure-amended soils was greater than N2O loss typically measured from waste-amended agricultural soils. However, it only represented up to 0.7% of the total N in the applied manure.

AB  - Pollinators play a key role within most terrestrial communities in maintaining plant populations, as well as pollinating many agricultural crops for seed and fruit production. The mobility of pollinating animals is significant to their importance but we know little about how landscape structure influences pollinator movements. Linear landscape features such as hedgerows and embankments are conspicuous features of agricultural landscape structure and are important artificial habitats in their own right. However, there has been some debate as to the function of these landscape elements as corridors between larger expanses of semi-natural habitat separated by urban and agricultural habitats. Few studies have specifically studied insect flight responses to linear landscape elements. By observing bumblebee flight behaviour along hedgerows and, by creating a medium-scale experimental array of flower patches using an artificial linear feature, we examined whether such structures can elicit an oriented flight response along them and therefore facilitate insect movement through the landscape. We found that both hedgerows and artificial linear landscape features can influence the flight directions of bumblebees ( Bombus spp. Hymenoptera, Apidae), one of Europe's most important groups of pollinators. A bioassay experiment in which Salvia pratensis (Lamiaceae) was planted into landscape patches with differing numbers of connecting hedgerows showed that this directional response can have a profound effect on plant reproductive success - plants had increased pollinator activity, pollen receipt and subsequent seed set in patches with more connections. The overall hedgerow connectedness of a landscape is therefore important both to bumblebee movement and to those plants which depend on bumblebees for pollination services.

AB  - The Arable Stewardship Pilot Scheme in England provided farmers with options for creating a range of habitat types on arable land. The prescribed methods of habitat establishment were derived from previous research, but the outcomes were uncertain when applied across the two large areas encompassed by the scheme. Vegetation was sampled from 294 sites representing overwinter stubble, spring fallow, undersown cereals, grass leys, wildlife seed mixtures, conservation headlands, no-fertiliser conservation headlands, sown grass margins, naturally regenerated grass margins and uncropped cultivated margins. Vegetation characteristics and differences between habitat options were broadly as predicted. Uncontrolled environmental factors accounted for more variation than habitat option at naturally regenerated sites, but not at sites with sown cover. Creation of simple habitats on arable land appears to be achievable in agri-environment schemes because the general outcomes are predictable. At a local level, potential effects of environmental factors also need to be taken into account. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Earthworm species contribute to soil ecosystem functions in varying ways. Important soil functions like structural maintenance and nutrient cycling are affected by earthworms, thus it is essential to understand how arable farm management influences earthworm species. One aim of arable field margin strips and non-inversion tillage is to enhance agrobiodiversity, however their influence on earthworm species assemblages remains unclear. In particular, on-farm studies conducted over multiple years that capture variability across the landscape are rare. The current study monitored earthworm species assemblages on 4 farms in Hoeksche Waard, The Netherlands, from 2010 to 2012. It was hypothesised that arable field margin strips (FM) and non-inversion tillage (NIT; a reduced tillage system that loosens subsoil at 30−35 cm depth) would have higher earthworm species abundances (epigeics and anecics in particular), soil organic matter, and soil moisture than adjacent mouldboard ploughing (MP) fields, and that earthworm numbers would decrease with distance away from FM into arable fields (MP only). FM contained a mean total earthworm abundance of 284 m −2 and biomass of 84 g m −2 whereas adjacent MP arable fields had only 164 earthworms m −2 and 31 g m −2 . Aporrectodea rosea , Lumbricus rubellus , Lumbricus terrestris , and Lumbricus castaneus were significantly more abundant in FM than adjacent arable soil under MP. However, no decreasing trend with distance from FM was observed in earthworm species abundances. A tillage experiment initiated on the farms with FM showed that relative to MP, NIT significantly increased mean total earthworm abundance by 34% to 275 m −2 and mean total earthworm biomass by 15% to 51 g m −2 overall sampling dates and farms. L. rubellus , A. rosea , and L. terrestris were significantly more abundant overall in NIT than MP. FM and NIT positively affected earthworm species richness and abundances and it is noteworthy that these effects could be observed despite variation in environmental conditions and soil properties between samplings, farms, and crops. Higher top-soil organic matter and less physical disturbance in FM and NIT likely contributed to higher earthworm species richness and abundances. The anecic species L. terrestris (linked to water infiltration and organic matter incorporation) was more abundant in FM, but densities remained very low in arable soil, irrespective of tillage system.

AB  - There have been major changes in agricultural practice over the past 50 years. The increasing efficiency of arable production has led to larger field sizes with the associated removal of many hedgerow field boundaries. This, together with high input farming practices, has had a deleterious effect on the quality of the rural landscape as a wildlife habitat. This study focuses on green lanes, that is, trackways bounded on both sides by hedgerows, and the adjacent field margins of arable crops and examines each habitat to determine their relative resource value to bumblebees. The vegetation communities within 15 green lane sites and those of the adjacent field margins were recorded, and subsequent analysis showed that species richness was significantly higher within the green lanes. Bee numbers were recorded at each site during 10 visits, both along the inside of green lane hedges and the outside of the opposite hedge on the field margins of the arable crops. At each visit the flower abundance of 10 plant groups was recorded for each habitat type. The results show that bumblebee abundance was significantly higher within the green lane habitat than on the field margins and that this difference was directly related to the abundance of flowers within the habitat. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - In this study we compared the vascular flora and butterfly fauna of green lanes, single hedged tracks and grass verges. Green lanes supported a significantly more diverse flora with >30% more species in a 200 m transect than other linear features. Indicator values confirmed the lower light and higher moisture levels expected in green lanes, but in this study did not confirm lower nitrogen levels or greater stress tolerator incidence. Significantly more butterfly species were recorded in the green lanes and butterfly abundance was more than double that along the other linear features. Greater numbers of butterfly species were associated with greater numbers of floral species and green lanes also supported more butterfly larval foodplants. Given the value of butterflies as indicator species reflecting both the quality of habitat in the countryside and changes in the environment these results combine to emphasise the biodiversity value of green lanes in addition to their historical and aesthetic value. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Grass hedges and no-till cropping systems reduced soil losses on standard erosion plots in ultra-narrow row (20 cm) cotton during a 4-year study (1999-2002). No-till cotton with grass hedges, no-till cotton without grass hedges, conventional-till cotton with grass hedges, and conventional-till cotton without grass hedges produced 4-year average annual soil losses of 1.8, 2.9, 4.0, and 30.8 t ha-1, respectively, and produced 4-year average runoff amounts of 267, 245, 353, and 585 mm, respectively. The annual ratio of soil loss for no-till ultra-narrow row cotton plots with grass hedges to those without hedges averaged 0.62. The annual ratio of soil loss for conventional-till plots with grass hedges to without hedges was 0.13. Averaged over all plots (with and without grass hedges), no-till plots had 86% less soil loss than conventional-till plots. No-till plots without grass hedges had 90% less soil loss than conventional-till plots without grass hedges. Grass hedges effectively reduced soil loss on erosion plots with similar cropping practices as compared to plots without hedges. Along with the reduced soil losses from no-till system as compared to conventional-till system, the no-till ultra-narrow row cotton system resulted in an average 0.2 t ha-1 yield increase as compared to the conventional-till system. Reduced soil loss and increased crop yield are both positive factors that the user should consider when adopting this cotton system. Other studies of contoured grass hedges on field-sized areas are being conducted to determine their applicability on larger areas with greater concentrations of runoff.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of different types of linear structures in the preservation of four xerothermic species (Centaurea scabiosa, Euphorbia cyparissias, Melampyrum arvense, and Salvia verticillata) and two weeds (Euphorbia exigua and Thymelaea passerina). Observations were conducted in the agricultural landscape of Western Volhynia with fields of different land use intensity (a large-scale farming system and small traditional arable fields). The total length of the studied structures was 4760 m and the following five categories of structures were distinguished: field road verges adjacent to large (I) and small fields (2), field margins between the patches of xerothermic grasslands as well as large (3) or small fields (4) and balks (5). The distribution and abundance of species mentioned above were recorded there. The survey showed that linear habitats are not suitable for all the studied species; margins between arable fields and grasslands were the most important habitats for both grassland and weed species. Factors responsible for their abundance and distribution along these margins included the following: type of farming system, exposure of the margin, and soil moisture. Grassland species occupied habitats adjacent to small traditional fields with other than southern exposure; weeds were more abundant in drier microhabitas.

AB  - Grass hedges are specialized vegetative buffers effective in trapping sediment. Information is needed on how the effectiveness of grass hedges changes over time after planting, and in response to hedge clipping management. Erosion from natural rainfall was measured during 13 yr after establishing single-row (eventually growing to be 1 m wide) miscanthus (Miscanthus sinensis Andersson) hedges at the lower end of erosion plots (21 m long, 5% slope) in a replicated Study involving conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) grown on silt loam soils (Typic Fragiudalfs) in Holly Springs, MS. Sediment yield Values from plots with and without grass hedges were analyzed with reference to the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to determine the conservation support practice ("P" factor) for sediment yield, which is the fractional reduction in sediment yield due to the presence of the grass hedge. The "P" factor of grass hedges was found to be about 0.5 in the establishment year and to decrease progressively with time for CT cotton. The "P" factor for grass hedges averaged 0.23 for CT wide-row cotton and 0.12 for Ultra narrow row (UNR) cotton studied with older hedges. "P" factors for NT were higher, averaging 0.5 for wide-row cotton and 0.65 for UNR cotton, perhaps reflecting a finer eroded sediment size distribution. Comparison of several methods of estimating hedge effectiveness showed that while observed monthly rainfall effects on soil erosion were not fully explained by the E130 term used in RUSLE, fitting more complex statistical models to the data did not appreciably alter estimates of fractional sediment yield reduction due to grass hedges. The results of this Study demonstrated that during extreme events, hedge effectiveness was enhanced ("P" was lowered) by management chat allowed accumulation of hedge clippings upslope of the hedges. However, for freshly tilled conditions, "P" values for 7-yr old hedges varied from 0.2 for monthly rainfall = 100 mm to 0.35 for monthly rainfall = 400 mm even when all residues were removed.

AB  - Grass hedges are specialized vegetative buffers effective in trapping sediment, but less is known about their ability to reduce or redirect runoff. Runoff and sediment yield from natural rainfall were measured during 8 yr from 0.1-ha contour-planted plots with and without 1-m-wide switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) hedges at their lower ends. Plots had slope lengths of 22 m with a steepness of 5%, were located on silt loam soils near Holly Springs, MS, and were cropped to conventional-tillage corn (Zea mays L). During the first 4 yr of the study, care was taken to conduct tillage is such a way that no soil was thrown into the grass hedge, while during the last 4 yr of the study, primary disk tillage immediately adjacent to the grass hedges created soil berms that acted as low terraces. Hedges reduced the fraction of rainfall that ran off the plots, and hedges with soil berms reduced runoff even more. The runoff curve number (CN) for a 2-yr return period rainfall event was about 78 for plots with no hedges, 70 for plots with hedges, and 61 for plots with hedges with berms. Without berms, 95% of runoff passed through the hedges. In contrast, with berms most runoff (&gt;85% from runoff events &lt;3 mm d -1; &gt;55% for events &lt;80 mm d -1) flowed upslope of and parallel to the hedges. With or without berms, grass hedges decrease sediment yield by a factor of 0.25 to 0.28. © Soil Science Society of America.

AB  - Lands under riparian and agricultural management differ in soil properties, water content, plant species and nutrient content and are therefore expected to influence denitrifier communities, denitrification and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions. Denitrifier community abundance, denitrifier community structure, denitrification gene expression and activity were quantified on three dates in a maize field and adjacent riparian zone. N(2)O emissions were greater in the agricultural zone, whereas complete denitrification to N(2) was greater in the riparian zone. In general, the targeted denitrifier community abundance did not change between agricultural and riparian zones. However, nosZ gene expression was greater in the riparian zone than the agricultural zone. The community structure of nirS-gene-bearing denitrifiers differed in June only, whereas the nirK-gene-bearing community structure differed significantly between the riparian and the agricultural zones at all dates. The nirK-gene-bearing community structure was correlated with soil pH, while no significant correlations were found between nirS-gene-bearing community structure and soil environmental variables or N(2)O emissions, denitrification or denitrifier enzyme activity. The results suggested for the nirK and nirS-gene-bearing communities different factors control abundance vs. community structure. The nirK-gene-bearing community structure was also more responsive than the nirS-gene-bearing community structure to change between the two ecosystems.

AB  - Vegetated filter strips help reduce non-point source pollution from agricultural areas. Even though they are an accepted and highly promoted practice, little quantitative data exist on their effectiveness under field conditions. The objective of this research was to determine the amount of nutrients and sediment removed by natural and planted filters. This was achieved by collecting and analyzing runoff at field edges and at various locations in vegetated buffers. Total weight of sediment and nutrients in runoff from North Carolina agricultural fields showed that the grass and riparian filter strips studied reduced runoff load by 50 to 80%. Total sediment decrease through the filters was about 80% for both grass and riparian vegetation. The reduction in the chemical load depended on the nutrient and its form. Filters reduced total P load by 50%, but 80% of the soluble PO4-P arriving at the field edge frequently passed through the Biters. The filters retained 20 to 50% of the NH4 and approximately 50% of the total Kjeldahl N and NO3. High-volume Bows commonly overwhelmed both grass and riparian filters next to cultivated fields. Forested ephemeral channels had little vegetation and were effective sediment sinks during the dry season but were ineffective during large storm events because there was little resistance to Bow. When possible, drainageways should be designed to hold sediment and to disperse the discharge into a riparian area.

AB  - The bean leaf beetle. Cerotoma trifurcata (Forster) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is a major insect pest of soybean in Nebraska and throughout much of the Midwest. This insect overwinters in the adult stage in litter in wooded areas such as shelterbelts. Historically, crop producers have been unsure of the merits of shelterbelts, especially if nearby crops are more likely to be infested by insect pests as a result. In this study, bean leaf beetle adults were sampled during the season by visually counting the number of beetles found on soybean plants early in the season and by sweep net sampling once plants were at the V4 stage (approximately 0.33 m tall). Sampling was done in 1997 and 1998 at the University of Nebraska Agricultural Research and Development Center in Saunders Co. in east-central Nebraska. Beetle counts were compared between shelterbelt-protected and -unprotected fields. In general, bean leaf beetles were more numerous in 1997 than in 1998 with abundance peaks occurring in late-July and early-September in both years. There were significant differences in bean leaf beetle counts from protected and unprotected fields on only three of the 11 and four of the 13 sampling dates in 1997 and 1998, respectively. On the sampling dates when significant differences were found, two of three in 1997 and three of four in 1998 had higher bean leaf beetle abundance in the protected soybean fields. The results of this study indicate a tendency for more bean leaf beetles in shelterbelt-protected soybean fields when differences are found, but beetle numbers were not significantly different between protected and unprotected fields on the majority of sample dates in the two years of this study. This study also reconfirms the presence of two generations of the bean leaf beetle in Nebraska.

AB  - Agri-environment schemes (AES) are central to the conservation of Europe's farmland biodiversity. The UK Government's Public Service Agreement target seeks to reverse the decline of farmland birds in England by 2020 through the use of AES. The Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) scheme, introduced in 2005, is the first non-competitive, broad-uptake stewardship scheme designed to deliver simple but effective environmental management on farms throughout England. Approximately 5 million hectares of farmland are currently entered into Environmental Stewardship (ES) agreements, and given the scale of this investment it is important to verify the efficacy of ELS as a mechanism for delivering biodiversity benefits. We used spatially referenced ES agreement data to assess the influence of specific management options and combinations of options on farmland bird population changes between 2005 and 2008 derived from standardized surveys carried out on over 2000 lowland farmland 1-km squares in England. The results showed only limited evidence for short-term effects of ES. Only Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra and Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris showed some landscape-specific positive associations with area under ELS management. There was also limited evidence for positive associations between specific management options and the population changes of the species at which they were aimed. The current pattern of option uptake may be limiting benefits of ELS, with boundary management accounting for over 50% of scheme compensation value. However, the time required for option maturation and the time lags in bird population responses to environmental change mean that it is too early to reach definitive conclusions about the success or failure of the scheme. The findings of this study will assist in the development of ELS by feeding into the 5-year review scheduled for 2010 and have implications for the development of similar schemes elsewhere in Europe.

AB  - Capsule: Hedgerows and margins managed under agri-environment schemes appear to attract greater numbers of some farmland bird species. Aims: To examine fine-scale habitat associations of farmland birds to determine whether Entry Level Stewardship, the wider countryside agri-environment scheme for England, provides a mechanism for affecting population changes. Methods: Ninety-seven 1-km squares in East Anglia were surveyed to create two-dimensional habitat maps showing the location of all habitat patches and associated stewardship management. Modified territory-mapping techniques were used to produce relative estimates of bird numbers within each discrete habitat patch within each square. The effect of Entry Level Stewardship on species density was then analysed using GLM s. Results: Boundaries managed under Entry Level Stewardship appeared to attract higher densities of Blue Tits, Dunnocks, Common Whitethroats and Yellowhammers. Margins managed under the scheme also had higher densities of Yellowhammers. Conclusions: Existing boundary habitat management under Entry Level Stewardship may provide a mechanism for increasing the populations of some farmland bird species. Boundary management options should continue to be promoted, although rebalancing the scheme more towards in-field options is likely to be more widely beneficial. © 2010 British Trust for Ornithology.

AB  - Shelterbelts of Pinus radiata and Cupressus macrocarpa are common landscape features on arable farmland in New Zealand. This study aimed to determine whether such shelterbelts could influence the relative abundance and diversity of beneficial and pest invertebrates commonly found in arable crops. Window intercept, yellow sticky and pitfall traps were placed next to shelterbelts or post and wire fences and also 50 m from these borders into adjacent crops on two arable farms in Canterbury and one in Wairarapa over 1-2 weeks in summer 2012 and autumn 2013. The abundance of given species/taxa varied considerably depending on farm location, season and field border type. However, the mean number of beneficial insect species/taxa per trap did not vary markedly between field border types or adjacent crops, while traps at shelterbelts or their adjacent crops caught more of some pest species/taxa than traps beside fences. The pine/macrocarpa shelterbelts did not markedly increase relative abundance or diversity of beneficial insects.

AB  - A study of bird activity was made within an area of about 100 acres (40 ha.) which included a small pasture, crops of field beans, peas, rape and wheat and about 2200 yd. (2000 m.) of hedgerow. Thirteen species of birds bred in the area and a further 16 species were regular or casual visitors. Seventeen visits were made between 17 May and 20 July and birds were recorded in the hedges, fields and roadside verges during a standard walk. These records suggested a tendency for the hedgerow nesting species to feed near the edges of fields rather than out in the middle during this period. More birds were seen in the bean, pea and rape crops than in the wheat and the pea field supported an especially large population. Examination of 6 sparrows and 2 Skylarks taken about the end of June showed that these were feeding mainly on beetles and aphids occurring on the crops rather than on soil invertebrates. Insecticides were not used at this site in 1966 but attention is directed to the possible impact of DDT on birds when used against pea moth or the rape blossom beetle in such circumstances. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author

AB  - Riparian ecosystems, through their unique position in the agricultural landscape and ability to influence nutrient cycles, can potentially reduce NO3 loading to surface and ground waters. The purpose of this study was to determine the fate of NO3 in shallow groundwater moving along a lateral flowpath from a grass seed cropping system through an undisturbed mixed-species herbaceous riparian area. Soil A (30-45 cm) and C horizon (135-150 cm) NO3, dissolved oxygen, and nitrous oxide concentrations were significantly higher in the cropping system than the adjacent riparian area. Nitrate concentrations in both horizons of the riparian soil were consistently at or below 0.05 mg N L-1 while cropping system concentrations ranged from 1 to 12 mg N L-1 Chloride data suggested that NO3 dilution occurred from recharge by precipitation. However, a sharp decrease in NO3/Cl ratios as water moved into the riparian area indicated that additional dilution of NO3 concentrations was unlikely. Riparian area A horizon soil water had higher dissolved organic carbon than the cropping system and when the riparian soil became saturated, available electron acceptors (O-2, NO3) were rapidly reduced. Dissolved inorganic carbon was significantly higher in the riparian area than the cropping system for both horizons indicating high biological activity. Carbon limitation in the cropping system may have led to microbial respiration using primarily 02 and to a lesser degree NO3. Within 6 m of the riparian/cropping system transition, NO3 was virtually undetectable.

AB  - Woody linear features of farmlands have received much attention as pools of diversity in European countries, but they have, in comparison, been little considered in eastern North American ecological studies. Here, we evaluate the relative contribution of environmental conditions, history of management practices within hedgerows, and adjacent land-use on herb and shrub species distribution in woody hedgerows of agricultural landscapes of southern Quebec, Canada. We pay particular attention to the distribution of forest herbs and weed species and identify the main factors that explain their presence. We also evaluate the amount of spatial structuring in the species data and explanatory variables.Our results show significant differences in species composition related to the unique influence of all sets of factors considered. Adjacent land-use (from intensive crop to fallow land) remains the best predictor of overall species distribution, followed by environmental conditions and history of management practices. The probability of finding forest herbs in hedgerows increases as intensity of adjacent agricultural practices (from intensive crop to fallow land) decreases. Potential weed species, on the other hand, are more likely to be found within narrow hedgerows adjacent to the more intensively managed fields. We discuss the results in terms of the interactions between the different determinants of plant diversity in hedgerows and demonstrate the necessity to distinguish between multiple structuring factors to devise proper conservation strategies. Such strategies will have to take into account the ecological as well as the agricultural exploitation context in which linear features are found to be effective.

AB  - During the last decades, structural, floristic and faunistic diversity of the agricultural landscapes in Northern and Western Europe has declined considerably owing to the intensification of agriculture from the 1950's on. In reaction to biodiversity loss, EU policy pursuited the ecologisation and multifunctionality of agriculture. Field margins do pioneering work in the ecologisation of agriculture since they are the interface between intensive farming practices and the wider environment. The presented multidisciplinary study investigates agro-ecological functions (nature conservation, agriculture, environment) and implications of newly created, unfertilised, sown and unsown field margin strips installed on ex-arable land to increase biodiversity. Margin strips were mown twice a year with a late first cut on 15 June and a regrowth cut on 15 September to meet nature conservation purposes. From conservational concern , species diversity on the long term seemed unaffected by the type of plant community that was installed. The decrease in species diversity was more pronounced under a mowing regime without removal of cuttings. The annual addition of mown roadside herbage significantly enhanced species richness. Convergence in vegetation composition between sown and unsown plots occurred in terms of species importance. From agricultural concern , the importance of economically important weeds Elymus repens Gould, Cirsium arvense L. and Urtica dioica Scop. was significantly higher when cuttings were not removed and in the unsown community. Seed dispersal into the adjacent crop was only of importance one year after installation of the margin strips; seedrain was significantly 8 times higher nearby the unsown community than nearby sown communities. The feeding value of herbage from field margin strips was low compared to the feeding value of herbage harvested in agricultural managed fertilized grassland, limiting its use in rations for highly productive livestock. From environmental concern , the reduction of soil mineral N nearby the boundary by the presence of a margin strip was responsable for the increase in abundance of less competitive species and enrichment of species diversity within the semi-natural boundary.

AB  - During the last decades, structural, floristic and faunistic diversity of the agricultural landscapes in Northern and Western Europe has declined considerably owing to the intensification of agriculture from the 1950’s on. In reaction to biodiversity loss, EU policy pursuited the ecologisation and multifunctionality of agriculture. Field margins do pioneering work in the ecologisation of agriculture since they are the interface between intensive farming practices and the wider environment. The presented multidisciplinary study investigates agro-ecological functions (nature conservation, agriculture, environment) and implications of newly created, unfertilised, sown and unsown field margin strips installed on ex-arable land to increase biodiversity. Margin strips were mown twice a year with a late first cut on 15 June and a regrowth cut on 15 September to meet nature conservation purposes. From conservational concern, species diversity on the long term seemed unaffected by the type of plant community that was installed. The decrease in species diversity was more pronounced under a mowing regime without removal of cuttings. The annual addition of mown roadside herbage significantly enhanced species richness. Convergence in vegetation composition between sown and unsown plots occurred in terms of species importance. From agricultural concern, the importance of economically important weeds Elymus repens Gould, Cirsium arvense L. and Urtica dioica Scop. was significantly higher when cuttings were not removed and in the unsown community. Seed dispersal into the adjacent crop was only of importance one year after installation of the margin strips; seedrain was significantly 8 times higher nearby the unsown community than nearby sown communities. The feeding value of herbage from field margin strips was low compared to the feeding value of herbage harvested in agricultural managed fertilized grassland, limiting its use in rations for highly productive livestock. From environmental concern, the reduction of soil mineral N nearby the boundary by the presence of a margin strip was responsable for the increase in abundance of less competitive species and enrichment of species diversity within the semi-natural boundary.

AB  - Early succession of newly created sown/unsown margin strips on ex-arable land, managed by two cuttings per year with/without removal of cuttings, was characterised by the replacement of annuals in favour of perennials, a steady increase in the importance of monocotyledons and a decrease in non-nitogen-fixing dicotyledons. Mowing with removal of cuttings delayed this succession pattern. Sorenson's qualitative similarity index revealed that species composition of the sown communities in terms of species occurrence became increasingly similar to the unsown plots. Furthermore, convergence in vegetation composition between sown and unsown plots occurred also in terms of species importance as assessed by Sorenson's quantitative index. Similarity, in species, importance was significantly enhanced by cutting with removal of cuttings. During the first three successional years, species diversity of sown and unsown communities converged in time, irrespective of mowing regime or location. The decrease in species diversity, number and density of sown wildflowers was more pronounced under a mowing regime without removal of cuttings. The annual addition of mown roadside herbage significantly enhanced species-richness, but not the importance of dicotyledons. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Effects of light and disturbance on species diversity and vegetation succession were assessed during early succession of newly created sown and unsown field margin strips installed along the sunny and shady side of a tree lane. During succession, disturbance by farming operations was simulated by a single rotocultivation of the margin strip. Two years after the disturbance event, species richness was not significantly determined by light regime or disturbance level. However, shortly after the disturbance event, disturbance caused a temporary increase in species richness on the unshaded side due to introgression by annual species in created gaps. On the shaded side, species richness was significantly lower in disturbed plots. Disturbance caused a temporary increase in importance of spontaneous annuals, which were quickly replaced by perennial sown and unsown monocotyledons and to a lesser extent by perennial unsown dicotyledons. The importance of spontaneous species within functional groups increased, resulting in higher similarity between sown and unsown vegetation. (0 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We studied the effects of two- to three-year-old unfertilized field margin strips, installed between the pre-existing field boundary and the field crop, on soil ammonium N and nitrate N, and on the botanical composition of the adjacent semi-natural vegetation in the field boundary. Margin plots were regenerated spontaneously or were sown to grass/forb mixtures and were managed under a cutting regime with removal of cuttings. In general, soil nitrate N, soil ammonium N and soil mineral N losses were significantly affected by distance from the field crop edge and not by plant community type. The further away from the crop edge, the lower soil nitrate ( up to fivefold lower than in the crop) was found in the margin strip, but soil ammonium N was approximately 50% higher close to nearby trees and shrubs. Inside the margin strip, total soil mineral N as well as N loss during winter was minimal at a distance of 5 m from the crop edge. The reduction of soil nitrate N near the boundary by the presence of a margin strip was responsible for the increase in abundance of less competitive species and for an up to 20% higher species-richness within the field boundaries. In summary, our results show clearly that margin strips both decrease N pollution of groundwater and increase botanical diversity. A minimal margin width of 5 m is recommended.

AB  - Dry matter (DM) yield and herbage quality of unfertilized mown field margin strips were studied during early succession in a field experiment over a period of three years. The experiment aimed to maximize botanical diversity and was conducted at two different locations with contrasting soil type and comprised four vegetation types (spontaneously regenerated versus sown vegetation) and three herbage removal strategies (herbage left versus herbage removed). The experimental factors investigated were location, vegetation and herbage removal. Margin strips were mown twice a year with a late first cut around 15 June and a regrowth cut around 15 September to meet nature conservation objectives. Average DM yield over the first three years was not significantly affected by herbage removal but increased significantly over time, irrespective of vegetation or herbage removal. Initially, sown margin strips significantly outyielded unsown margin strips, but differences in DM yield converged over time. The mid-June cut yielded significantly more than the regrowth cut but its herbage quality was significantly lower. Herbage from the unsown margin strip had a significantly better forage quality than herbage from sown margin strips. Forage quality decreased over time, irrespective of location or vegetation. Changes over time in DM yield and quality were attributed to changes in species composition. The herbage quality of field margins was lower than the herbage quality of intensively managed grassland, limiting its use in rations for highly productive livestock.

AB  - We studied the effect of different ways to establish and to maintain unfertilised field margins on the development of potential weeds and seed dispersal into adjacent crops. Plant communities in field margins either developed spontaneously or were sown with different seed mixtures of grasses and forbs. Margins were mown twice a year and the cuttings were either removed or left in situ. Three years after establishment, the importance of the unsown rhizomatous species Elytrigia repens and Urtica dioica was significantly higher in the unsown community or when cuttings were not removed after mowing. Seed dispersal from the margin into adjacent crops was important in the unsown community during the first year after establishment. Between 82% and 99% of the seeds were disseminated within 4 m from the margin strip. Overall risk of contaminating the adjacent crop with weeds originating from the field margin strip was concentrated within a few metres of the crop edge. In order to minimise the dissemination of weed species and invasion by noxious vegetatively propagated weeds on nutrient-rich land, it is recommended that field margins are established by sowing and cuttings removed after each cut.

AB  - Dramatic changes have occurred in agricultural landscapes of western: Europe since the 1950s. Their effects on biodiversity have been documented at local scales in terms of agricultural practices and management of uncultivated elements, more than at the landscape level. The highest diversity of agricultural landscape structure found in Brittany (France) is characterised by hedgerows surrounding arable fields and permanent grasslands. Some areas did not change much over a few decades, while others were totally transformed by agricultural intensification, field enlargement and removal of hedges. The present paper aimed at examining if this landscape context affected carabid beetles communities in hedgerows. In 11 sites of 1 km(2) each, land use diversity and heterogeneity, hedgerow connectivity and landscape openness were measured. Carabid beetles sampled in hedgerows were identified to species, and grouped in functional units. Multivariate analyses were used to relate the spatial distribution of insects to different parameters of landscape structure. The results show a significant relationship between landscape structure and carabid communities. Forest species were more abundant in dense hedgerow networks with a relatively high ratio of permanent grasslands. Landscape opening induced a shift in species composition; the relative abundance of large species decreased while small, mobile and more ubiquitous species were favoured. Two trajectories of landscape change were identified, which led to different responses in communities, the increase in maize for milk production opening the landscape far more than cereal crops associated with industrial pig or poultry production. Changes were most important in the latter case. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Experiences from the Mitigation Options for Phosphorus and Sediment (MOPS) projects, which aim to determine the effectiveness of measures to reduce pollutant loading from agricultural land to surface waters, have been used to contribute to the findings of a recent paper (Kay et al., 2009, Agricultural Systems, 99, 67-75), which reviewed the efficacy of contemporary agricultural stewardship measures for ameliorating the water pollution problems of key concern to the UK water industry. MOPS1 is a recently completed 3-year research project on three different soil types in the UK, which focused on mitigation options for winter cereals. MOPS] demonstrated that tramlines can be the major pathway for sediment and nutrient transfer from arable hillslopes, and that although minimum tillage, crop residue incorporation, contour cultivation, and beetle banks also have potential to be cost-effective mitigation options, tramline management is the one of the most promising treatments for mitigating diffuse pollution losses, as it was able to reduce sediment and nutrient losses by 72-99% in four out of five site years trialled. Using information from the MOPS projects, this paper builds on the findings of Kay et al. to provide an updated picture of the evidence available and the immediate needs for research in this area.

AB  - Farming intensification in recent decades has led to an alarming level of degradation and loss of wildlife and its habitat such as hedgerows. The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has emerged as a central issue in ecological sciences, but the impact of regarding hedgerow function as a potential source of biological control agents against agricultural pests remains poorly understood. In this paper, we assessed effects of the arthropod community in a neighbouring hedge on the distribution of the pest psylla, Cacopsylla pyri, in a pear orchard over three consecutive years (1999-2001). We measured the diversity of the arthropod community in the hedge and in the orchard at increasing distances from the hedge using Shannon index diversity. Other indices and statistics such the Hellinger and L-1 distances were used to measure dissimilarities between spatial and temporal population distributions patterns. Our results showed in particular a decreasing diversity gradient as distance from the hedge increased and a convergence between predator populations in the orchard and the hedgerow during psylla proliferation. The beneficial arthropod exchanges occurring between the mixed hedgerow and the pear orchard during the pest proliferation period suggested that field border management could be used in an integrated pest management strategy aimed at reducing insecticide use.

AB  - Although there has been a clear quantitative and qualitative decline in traditional hedgerow network landscapes during last century, hedgerows are crucial for the conservation of rural biodiversity, functioning as an important habitat, refuge and corridor for numerous species. To safeguard this conservation function, insight in the basic organizing principles of hedgerow plant communities is needed. The vegetation composition of 511 individual hedgerows situated within an ancient hedgerow network landscape in Flanders, Belgium was recorded, in combination with a wide range of explanatory variables, including a selection of spatial variables. Non-parametric statistics in combination with multivariate data analysis techniques were used to study the effect of individual explanatory variables. Next, variables were grouped in five distinct subsets and the relative importance of these variable groups was assessed by two related variation partitioning techniques, partial regression and partial canonical correspondence analysis, taking into account explicitly the existence of intercorrelations between variables of different factor groups. Most explanatory variables affected significantly hedgerow species richness and composition. Multivariate analysis showed that, besides adjacent land use, hedgerow management, soil conditions, hedgerow type and origin, the role of other factors such as hedge dimensions, intactness, etc., could certainly not be neglected. Furthermore, both methods revealed the same overall ranking of the five distinct factor groups. Besides a predominant impact of abiotic environmental conditions, it was found that management variables and structural aspects have a relatively larger influence on the distribution of plant species in hedgerows than their historical background or spatial configuration. © 2004 Elsevier SAS.

AB  - Vole demographics are often modified close to wooded environments. Population monitoring in such settings reveals substantial edge effects, although these have seldom been quantified. This study compares the abundance of common vole Microtus arvalis (Pallas, 1778) populations at various distances from three types of wooded environment (hedgerow, copse and forest) and in two types of habitat (temporary and permanent grassland). In temporary grassland, substantial edge effects were detected along the boundaries of forests and hedgerows. At 100 m from the forest edge, voles were twice more abundant than at 50 m, four times more than at 25 m and eight times more than at 5 m. In permanent grassland, the edge effect was such that voles were practically absent up to 100 m from the forest edge. For both types of grassland, the edge effect was more pronounced for forest habitat than for hedgerows, that is, for elements with a large surface area of wooded environment. Our results suggest that landscape context may greatly affect the local abundance of voles. Given the considerable damage done by M. arvalis, the presence of wooded patches in grassland areas leads to lower vole densities in adjacent areas and this might be an alternative method to control M. arvalis as a pest species.

AB  - The loss of connectivity caused by habitat fragmentation is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. This is of particular concern in agricultural landscapes, which combine increased levels of fragmentation with larger numbers of endangered species than other landscapes. Corridors (e.g. linear landscape elements) are a popular conservation strategy to counteract fragmentation effects. Grassy field margins (GFMs) have been established throughout Europe as part of agri-environmental schemes. The primary goal of these measures is to protect water quality, but it is suggested biodiversity may benefit via a corridor function; Being set up along watercourses, GFMs may spontaneously form a coherent network of corridors in agricultural landscapes. We tested this hypothesis by monitoring movement strategies of Meadow brown butterflies (Maniola jurtina L.) in GFMs. Results indicated that butterfly movement was facilitated by this new landscape element, supporting its corridor function. Mechanistically, dispersal occurred through foraging movements rather than movements adapted to dispersal. Spatial configurations of GFMs were also explored in a large agricultural area and demonstrated that the GFM policy is adequate to provide a corridor function. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The investigations were carried out in 2002-2006 in two municipalities of Konopnica and Jastkow close to the western part of Lublin, Poland. The aim of the study was to identify the condition of bee flora and determine the floristic richness depending on the biotops in agricultural landscape. Flora of the anthropogenic refuge areas consists of 214 species, among them 80% were flow taxons. Apophytes (162 species - 78%) predominated on all types of biotops under consideration. Perennials predominated in flora of boundary strips and bush communities. Mainly annual (40%) and biennial (15%) species comprise the flora of fallows. A great number of bee taxons represent meadow, segetal or ruderal communities. Most of flow plants compose loose patches, but their successive blooming ensures a source of food for Apoidea from early spring till the end of summer. The flora of boundary strips, bush communities and fallows significantly increases the biodiversity in agricultural landscape. The treatments including sowing, mainly on fallows with nectariferous and polleniferous species, would enrich generally weak flows in highly agricultural landscape.

AB  - Understanding the factors that have an impact on the diversity of forage flora in the agricultural landscape is a key issue in the maintenance and control of food niches for pollinators. Field margins are common linear structures in the agricultural landscape. In the present study, we evaluated the factors that exert an impact on the forage flora composition and on the diversity in field margins. The study was conducted in the 2010 - 2011 time period across the agricultural landscape on the Lublin Upland of SE Poland. Data on the forage flora were obtained while making floristic charts along 45 transect plots x 300 m; the total length being 13500 m. Multivariate ordination techniques (PCA and RDA) were employed to analyse forage-flora characteristics. Field margins represent valuable refuge areas for forage-species richness, but not for the abundance of forage species. On field margins, forage-species diversity benefits from the location of natural habitats (forests or meadows), primarily if the distance from these habitats is < 1000 m or the field acreage is < 10 ha. The shift from heterogeneous habitats to a more homogeneous landscape causes a reduction of forage floral diversity. Due to lack of dense forage-species patches, the promotion of sowing nectariferous and/or polleniferous species seems to be a reasonable management method to enhance the quantitative food niche on field margins and to support the conservation of pollinators in the areas surrounding farms.

AB  - 1. Vegetation cover was manipulated within enclosures on a field boundary in southern England to test experimentally the effect on the overwintering of Tachyporus hypnorum and Demetrias atricapillus populations, species that use grassy boundaries of arable fields as refugia during winter. 2. Winter survival was lowest for beetles enclosed on bare earth and highest for those enclosed on tussocks of Dactylis glomerata. The contrast in structural complexity of the experimental treatments caused a 44%, 43% and 36% variation in the final densities of beetles during three successive winters. 3. The densities of T. hypnorum on adjacent field boundaries were estimated from the composition of their vegetation cover and the survival rates of the beetles on different treatments. There was no significant difference between the number of T. hypnorum allocated to seven field boundaries by the model and the number of beetles sampled from soil and vegetation of those boundaries at the end of winter. 4. The cover of boundaries by non-tussock grass species accounted for 91% of the predicted overwintering numbers of T hypnorum because tussock grasses and bare soil were not common on existing boundaries. We therefore considered the influence of boundary structure on the overwintering of the beetles. 5. Higher winter densities of T. hypnorum were sampled from boundaries with deeper soil and greater vegetation height, that were wider and higher above the field level, with an east to west orientation, warmer mean daytime temperature and lower soil moisture. 6. A quadrat survey was carried out in Norway on the equivalent group to T. hypnorum that comprised T. hypnorum, T. chrysomelinus and T. obtusus. With multiple regression, more individuals of Tachyporus spp. and other beneficial arthropods occurred in sampling units from boundaries raised higher above the field level that comprised grass cover with a high proportion of tussock grass. 7. Other factors such as pre-winter crop husbandry, food supply and parasitism may affect the dispersal power, habitat selection and cold hardiness of beneficial arthropod species within available boundaries and account for the observed variation in beetle numbers.

AB  - The management of field margin strips for the enhancement of biodiversity of plant-insect communities and natural-enemy populations was studied on experimental farms near Gottingen (Germany). Young and old, sown and naturally developed field margin strips were compared and differences to large fallows established. The five types of field margin strips (around cereal fields) were: (1, 2) 1- or 6-year-old naturally developed strips, (3) strips sown with a Phacelia mixture, (4) strips sown with a mixture of 19 wild flower species, and (5) strips sown with winter wheat or oat as a control. The naturally developed vegetation of the field margin strips was dominated by aggressive weeds, presumably due to the intensive farming practices and the fertile soils. Cirsium arvense populations decreased, while Elymus repens populations increased with age of habitat. Sowings were suitable to suppress these aggressive weeds. Potted plants of mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) and red clover (Trifolium pratense) were exposed in the field margin strips to study arthropod colonization of these experimentally standardized plant patches. Arthropod species richness did not differ between field margin types, reflecting the overall similarity in floristic diversity, but sprayed and strip-free edges of cereal fields had a reduced diversity. Dispersal of insect populations of red clover into the cereal fields decreased with increasing distance, but benefited from adjacent field margin strips. Populations of predators (mainly spiders) as well as predator-prey ratios were significantly larger in 6-year-old than in 1-year-old strips emphasizing the importance of habitat age for natural enemies and possible biological control. Predator-prey ratios were also higher on old than young fallows. Large fallows had greater predator-prey ratios than small field margin strips emphasizing the trophic-level hypothesis of island biogeography in that the relative importance of natural enemies increased with habitat area. Insect species richness was only marginally influenced by area and not by age. As species richness of predators did not increase with area and age, species diversity and the possible biological-control function did not covary.

AB  - The ecosystem service of insect pest regulation by natural enemies, such as primary parasitoids, may be enhanced by the presence of uncultivated, semi-natural habitats within agro-ecosystems, although quantifying such host-parasitoid interactions is difficult. Here, we use rRNA 16S gene sequencing to assess both the level of parasitism by Aphidiinae primary parasitoids and parasitoid identity on a large sample of aphids collected in cultivated and uncultivated agricultural habitats in Western France. We used these data to construct ecological networks to assess the level of compartmentalization between aphid and parasitoid food webs of cultivated and uncultivated habitats. We evaluated the extent to which uncultivated margins provided a resource for parasitoids shared between pest and nonpest aphids. We compared the observed quantitative ecological network described by our molecular approach to an empirical qualitative network based on aphid-parasitoid interactions from traditional rearing data found in the literature. We found that the molecular network was highly compartmentalized and that parasitoid sharing is relatively rare between aphids, especially between crop and noncrop compartments. Moreover, the few cases of putative shared generalist parasitoids were questionable and could be due to the lack of discrimination of cryptic species or from intraspecific host specialization. Our results suggest that apparent competition mediated by Aphidiinae parasitoids is probably rare in agricultural areas and that the contribution of field margins as a source of these biocontrol agents is much more limited than expected. Further large-scale (spatial and temporal) studies on other crops and noncrop habitats are needed to confirm this.

AB  - The study was carried out in western Poland (Turew region) in two shelterbelts of different age (the younger - 6 years old and the older - 11 years old) planted across croplands, in adjacent fields and in the field located in deforested area (control field). Soil samples were taken twice: in the autumn and spring from the centre of each shelterbelt, from the ecotone, and in the field at a distance of 15 and 50 m from the edge of the shelterbelts. The density of nematode communities fluctuated unpredictably, in autumn it was very low and ranged from 276 to 641×103, in spring it ranged from 388 to 1931 × 103 individuals per 1 m2. Most numerous trophic groups were: bacterivores, fungivores and obligate plant feeders, while facultative plant feeders, omnivores and predators achieved low level. The abundance of predators in older shelterbelt was significantly (P ≤0.05) higher than that in the younger one and decreased with increasing distance from the shelterbelt towards the field. The communities in shelterbelt and its ecotone were more diverse, which was reflected by the higher number of genera (19-31) and higher values of Shannon-Wiener diversity index H′ (3.3-4.0), than those in the fields where the number of genera ranged from 15 to 25 and Shannon-Wiener diversity index H′ ranged from 2.5 to 3.5. In the younger shelterbelt and in the control field the soil food-web assessed with indices derived from analysis of nematode communities was considered as composed mainly of basal components, i.e. cosmopolitan species feeding on bacteria and fungi occurring everywhere even in degraded environments. While the food web in older shelterbelt was consisted mainly of enrichment components, i.e. bacteria feeding species of very short life cycle, with high food requirements which occur in the environment rich in bacteria). The values of Channel Index which informs about the predominant pathway of decomposition (through bacteria or fungi) showed that in majority of sites bacterial processes predominated. Only in the older shelterbelt the participation of fungal decomposition channel was higher (&gt;50%) and increased with increasing distance from the shelterbelt towards the centre of the field. The results of Correspondence Analysis showed that first two axis explained 40.3% of the variance. The generic composition of nematode communities in the 11-years old shelterbelt differed from that in the 6-years old shelterbelt. Nematode communities inhabiting the ecotone of younger shelterbelt were very similar to the communities in the shelterbelt, while the communities in ecotone of older shelterbelt differed from those in the shelterbelts. Nematode communities inhabiting the control field were similar to those inhabiting the field adjacent to younger shelterbelt.

AB  - On slopes soils there take place important nutrient losses that inflict pollution of surface waters. The most lost nutrient is nitrogen yet the phosphorus from soluble fertilizers is also lost. These nutrients reach into surface waters where determine eutrophication phenomenon. In order to implement the objectives of Water Frame Directive 2000/60/CE there have been searched methods for mitigation the nutrient pollution from slope soils. These methods are: - the using of organic - mineral fertilizers (L120) instead of soluble phosphorus fertilizers (superphosphates); - buffer strips at the bottom of the slope;- filtering materials for water from creeks. The applying of these methods have contributed to the reduction of the nutrient losses (nitrogen and phosphorus) from slope soils with values ranging between 38-41% by applying organic - mineral fertilizer and by 52-64% when buffer strips were installed. The using of straw ballots as filtering materials for creek water has determined the reduction of nutrient losses by 72%. This way, the using of organic - mineral fertilizer on lignite base (L-120) has determined the diminishing of phosphorus losses on slope soils due to bonding phosphorus from this fertilizer in an organic - mineral matrix that speeds up the retrogradation and solubilisation processes of phosphorus. The using of grass buffer strips of 10 m wide on level curves at the bottom of the slope along Preajba creek has determined an obvious decreasing of the eroded soil quantity, of humus and nutrient losses due to better retention by root system and its higher density. Straw ballots across the course of a creek are a good filter for running waters. The straw action is similar with soil colloidal complex, they retain chemical ions from water like: NO3, NH4, K, PO4, etc. By using straw ballots there can be avoided the eutrophication phenomenon of the surface waters. The using of crops like natural and sown pasture as well as cereals could be a method to mitigate nutrient losses on slopes. Wide row crops should be avoided as much as possible.

AB  - Semi-natural grasslands can support diverse faunal and floral communities, including grassland birds, beneficial insects, and native wildflowers. Monitoring biodiversity of this type of ecosystem is important to assess abundance and richness of grassland-associated species, evaluate success of establishing grasslands, and to assess overall ecosystem health. We tested butterflies as surrogates for birds and plants to assess establishment success of semi-natural grassland buffers in north-central Mississippi using Spearman rank correlation (Spearman's rho). Disturbance and grassland butterfly guilds were generally not suitable surrogates for grassland bird metrics, non-grassland bird metrics, or nest density metrics. Butterflies did have consistent positive correlations with plant species richness and forb metrics, as well as consistent negative correlations with grass metrics, but these correlations were generally smaller than what is considered suitable to serve as surrogates. In general, butterflies were not suitable surrogates for birds or plants in semi-natural grassland buffers.

AB  - Butterflies are important components of biodiversity in grassland ecosystems and provide ecosystem services such as pollination. Although agricultural intensification has led to a scarcity of native grassland habitats within most agricultural landscapes of North America, fragmented remnants and semi-natural habitats may support diverse communities, including butterflies, as long as vital resources such as host plants are available. The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Conservation Reserve Program practice CP33 Habitat Buffers for Upland Birds (USDA 2004) provides semi-natural grassland habitat in agricultural landscapes, but a knowledge gap exists about impacts of prescribed disturbance (e.g. burning or disking) on butterflies. We monitored butterfly habitat and butterfly communities on experimentally manipulated CP33 grassland buffers in Clay County, Mississippi from 2007 to 2009. Disturbance guild butterfly species richness did not differ among treatments. However, disturbance guild abundance was positively affected by disking in both the first and second growing seasons following disking, and the magnitude of this response varied between years. Effects of burning on disturbance guild abundance did not differ from the control treatment. There were no treatment differences for grassland guild butterfly abundance and species richness suggesting that periodic disturbance does not unduly impact grassland-associated butterflies in the southeastern US. Our results support current USDA practice standards that require periodic disturbance during the 10-year contract, but restrict the disturbance to 1/3 or 1/4 of grassland buffer area in a given year.

AB  - In the Neotropics, the effect of agriculture on freshwater habitats is still poorly understood, particularly with respect to sugarcane expansion to meet increased ethanol demands. The variation in taxonomic composition, community attributes and trophic structure of fish assemblages from streams under different riparian zone preservation conditions were studied. Nine stream reaches under the following riparian vegetation conditions were selected: Native Forest (NF), with mostly primary forest; Secondary Forest (SF), which included sites with vegetation in an advanced stage of regeneration surrounded by sugarcane plantations; and Sugarcane sites (SC), located in areas without riparian vegetation, adjacent to sugarcane crops. Forty-one species were collected. The variance partitioning and partial Redundancy Analysis (pRDA) indicated that community composition and trophic structure were significantly explained by riparian condition and spatial variations, while diversity, richness, abundance and biomass were only explained by season and space, with higher diversity and richness at the SF sites. Abundance-Biomass curves (ABC curves) suggested that sugarcane plantations destabilized fish assemblages, especially at the more intensively managed sites, which seem to influence stream integrity and associated fish fauna. We concluded that both physical conditions of streams and some attributes of fish communities reflected the different levels of preservation of the riparian buffers, but given the influence of regional processes which have a pervasive role in shaping local assemblages, land use at the watershed scale seemed to be important especially to explain the higher richness and diversity found at the SF sites.

AB  - Effectiveness of fitter strips may change over a period of years because key soil and vegetation conditions change after conversion of cultivated farmland to permanent vegetation. The main objectives of this study were to: 1) determine if effectiveness of a filter strip changes over years since establishment, and 2) determine if temporal change depends on vegetation type. Four vegetation treatments were replicated five times in 3 x 7.5 M (10 X 25 ft) Plots. Plots containing all-grass (New Grass) and grass with trees and shrubs (New Forest) were established in spring Of 1995 among otherwise similar plots that contained either grass since ca. 1970 (Old Grass) or were re-cultivated and re-ptanted annually with grain sorghum (Crop). Once each summer, in 1995, 1996, 1997, 2003, and 2004, identically prepared solutions containing sediment, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer, and bromide tracer were applied to the upper end of each plot during a simulated rainfall event Of 2.5 cm (1 in) in 30 minutes, and the load and concentration of runoff components were measured in outflow from the plots. Retention of solution components and reduction of their concentrations by the New Grass and New Forest plots improved from effectiveness similar or less than the Crop plots to effectiveness similar to the Old Grass plots within three growing seasons. Improvement coincided with the development of denser vegetative ground cover and a slower rate of runoff flow through the plots. Change in infiltration accounted for most of the improvement in overall effectiveness. There was no evidence of divergence in the performance of New Grass and New Forest plots. We conclude that filter strip performance improves over a period of years since establishment. Most of the change occurs within three growing seasons after establishment. Infiltration characteristics account for most of that change. Grass and forest vegetation are equally effective as filter strips for at least 10 growing seasons after establishment.

AB  - Spatially nonuniform runoff reduces the water quality performance of constant-width filter strips. A geographic information system (GIS)-based tool was developed and tested that employs terrain analysis to account for spatially nonuniform runoff and produce more effective filter strip designs. The computer program, AgBufferBuilder, runs with ArcGIS versions 10.0 and 10.1 (Esri, Redlands, California) and uses digital elevation models to identify detailed spatial patterns of overland runoff to field margins. The tool then sizes filter dimensions according to those patterns using buffer area ratio relationships. The resulting design is larger along segments where more runoff flows and smaller along segments where runoff is less and delivers a constant level of trapping efficiency around the field margin for sediment and sediment-bound pollutants. The tool also can estimate trapping efficiency of existing filter strips or hypothetical configurations. In a validation test, estimates of sediment trapping efficiency using the tool's assessment function compared closely to measurements taken on large field plots in central Iowa. Using AgBufferBuilder, designs developed for a sample of fields in the midwestern United States were estimated to trap nearly double the sediment, on average, during a design storm than constant-width configurations having equivalent total filter area. AgBufferBuilder can be used to bolster environmental performance of filter strips where runoff is spatially nonuniform.

AB  - 1. Uncropped field margins are important foraging habitats on farmland for many declining bird species and are a key component of Agri-Environment Schemes across Europe. Maximizing the value of foraging habitats requires detailed knowledge of the factors influencing habitat selection and food availability. 2. We firstly conducted an observational study of foraging habitat selection by breeding yellowhammers Emberiza citrinella L. on lowland mixed farmland, in relation to underlying invertebrate and vegetation characteristics. 3. There was a clear seasonal shift in the relative use of field margins and cereal crops. Margins were used less than crops in late summer, despite supporting higher invertebrate abundance relative to cereals. Seasonal increases in vegetation height were most marked in margins, suggesting the seasonal decline in margin use may reflect reduced food accessibility. 4. In the second phase of the study, field margins were cut experimentally to create short, open patches within taller margin swards. The use of cut patches by foraging yellowhammers increased significantly between early and late summer, and patches were used more frequently with increasing height of adjacent uncut margin. These findings strongly support the theory that tall vegetation reduces margin accessibility in late summer. 5. Synthesis and applications. Provision of invertebrate-rich field margins is a core component of Agri-Environment Schemes, but current prescriptions may result in them having limited value in late summer. More effective management, such as more frequent cutting, may be required to maximize the benefits for foraging birds by creating short, open vegetation patches. Measures to increase accessibility to invertebrates on farmland are likely to benefit a range of bird species across a variety of crop types.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to assess the effectiveness of two grass covers (buffer zone and grass-covered inter-row), to reduce pesticide leaching, and subsequently to preserve groundwater quality. Lower amounts of pesticides leached through grass-cover soil columns (2.7-24.3% of the initial amount) than the bare soil columns (8.0-55.1%), in correspondence with their sorption coefficients. Diuron was recovered in higher amounts in leachates (8.9-32.2%) than tebuconazole (2.7-12.9%), in agreement with their sorption coefficients. However, despite having a sorption coefficient similar to that of diuron, more procymidone was recovered in the leachates (10.2-55.1%), probably due to its facilitated transport by dissolved organic matter. Thus even in this very permeable soil, higher organic matter contents associated with grass-cover reduce the amount of pesticide leaching and limit the risk of groundwater contamination by the pesticides. The results of diuron and tebuconazole transfer through undisturbed buffer zone soil columns are in agreement with field observations on the buffer zone. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. The effects of biotic and abiotic factors on the distribution of three species of satyrid butterfly (Aphantopus hyperantus, Pyronia tithonus and Maniola jurtina) in arable field margins were studied in a block of arable farmland on a North Hampshire farm. 2. Non-floral factors affecting distribution included the degree of shelter, insolation, width of hedgebank or grass verge, and uncultivated habitat. Farm tracks adjacent to the field boundaries exerted a negative effect on abundance. 3. Floral variables affecting distribution included the abundance of flowers of bramble (Rubus fruticosus), thistle-like Compositae, marjoram (Origanum vulgare) and mayweeds (Matricaria spp.) in conservation headlands. Negative variables included abundance of cow parsley (Anthriscus sylvestris) and old man's beard (Clematis vitalba); although the latter was negative for A. hyperantus and M. jurtina, it was a positive variable for P. tithonus. 4. The distribution of butterflies in arable field margins is discussed in relation to landscape structure, microclimate and resources.

AB  - In Britain, much emphasis has been placed on conserving butterfly species in specialized habitats, since this is where most of it's threatened butterflies exist, whilst the wider countryside has been largely overlooked. However, there is increasing awareness that small improvements to the dominant landscape could potentially reap huge benefits to the populations of many of Britain's butterfly species. Recent studies have also stressed the importance of the landscape scale in the conservation of butterflies in small fragmented habitats. In this paper, we examine data from a variety of sources and conclude that the importance of shelter in open landscapes may be underestimated since recording is often restricted to the optimum conditions suggested by the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme. In less favourable conditions, butterflies may place greater reliance on those components of the landscape offering shelter. In light of the current policy of agricultural de-intensification we discuss how modifications to our current landscapes could benefit a wide range of species. © 1997 Chapman & Hall.

AB  - Monthly pitfall trapping in 1990 and 1991 at Horseshoe Bend Experimental Area, Clarke County, Georgia, yielded 112 species of spiders belonging to 25 families. Examination of additional collections brings the site total to 145 species in 26 families, including southern or southeastern range extensions for Agelenopsis kastoni, Sphodros atlanticus, Bathyphantes pallidus, Eridantes erigonoides, Floricomus tallulae, Grammonota inornata, and Walckenaeria carolina, and a northeastern range extension for Paratheridula perniciosa. Ceraticelus emertoni and Neriene redacta are also reported from Georgia for the first time. The proportional distribution of pitfall-trapped species within families does not differ significantly from that reported for Berry's (1966) pitfall trapping in the North Carolina Piedmont (about 450 km away), suggesting regional similarity of the Piedmont ground-layer spider fauna. Data on phenology and relative catch of species among the four habitats sampled (conventional and no-tillage agricultural fields, grassy field borders, and the surrounding deciduous riparian forest) are given for the most abundant species. Habitat selection of 15 abundant species was statistically analyzed; most of the species' populations displayed strong preferences for particular habitats. It is clear that species "spillover" from adjacent habitats contributes to the faunal richness of each habitat, and that maintenance of a mosaic of habitats within an agroecosystem landscape maximizes spider biodiversity.

AB  - Riparian buffer zones are important for both natural and developed ecosystems throughout the world because of their ability to retain nutrients, prevent soil erosion, protect aquatic environments from excessive sedimentation, and filter pollutants. Despite their importance, the microbial community structures of riparian buffer zones remains poorly defined. Our objectives for this study were twofold: first, to characterize the microbial populations found in riparian buffer zone soils; and second, to determine if microbial community structure could be linked to denitrification enzyme activity (DEA). To achieve these objectives, we investigated the microbial populations of a riparian buffer zone located downslope of a pasture irrigated with swine lagoon effluent, utilizing DNA sequencing of the 16S rDNA, DEA, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) of the denitrification genes nirK, nirS, and nosZ. Clone libraries of the 16S rDNA gene were generated from each of twelve sites across the riparian buffer with a total of 986 partial sequences grouped into 654 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The Proteobacteria were the dominant group (49.8% of all OTUs), with the Acidobacteria also well represented (19.57% of all OTUs). Analysis of qPCR results identified spatial relationships between soil series, site location, and gene abundance, which could be used to infer both incomplete and total DEA rates.

AB  - Riparian buffer zones can improve water quality and enhance habitat, but a comprehensive yet rapid method that can assist the resource manager in assessing the effectiveness of buffers is not available. The aim of this paper is to describe and illustrate the use of a newly developed field-based evaluation tool for riparian buffer zones in agricultural catchments. The Buffer Zone Inventory and Evaluation Form (BZIEF) incorporates criteria-based scoring systems developed from literature review, subsequent peer-review, and then a pilot field study. Use of the BZIEF is demonstrated by comparing buffer zones in three catchments established for water quality and habitat improvement under the Water Fringe Option agrienvironment scheme in England in order to assess whether the buffers were likely to provide environmental enhancement. Results among the three catchments were generally similar; buffer zones scored highly for their abundant vegetation cover, lack of erosion, stream habitat quality, and sufficient width. Furthermore, previous grassland or arable land use did not substantially affect buffer zone ratings. However, the BZIEF indicated that inappropriate soil characteristics in one catchment were likely to constrain buffer zone effectiveness for improving water quality. In another catchment, poor riparian vegetation diversity and structure may yield ineffective habitat enhancement, according to the BZIEF. It was concluded that the BZIEF might be a useful tool for buffer zone comparison and monitoring, even though more work is needed to test and validate the method. For example, the BZIEF could be used to target appropriate locations for buffer zones and is flexible, so could be adapted for different policies, objectives and regions.

AB  - The influence of shelterbelts on the erodibility of soil by wind was studied at three chosen shelterbelts of Southern Moravia, Czech Republic - near the shelterbelts in the cadastral areas of Dolní Dunajovice, Micmanice and Suchá Loz. Ambulatory measurements of wind velocity as so as soil sampling for soil humidity analyses, non-erodible and clay particles analyses were done during the year of 2006. Subsequently, real erodibility of soil by wind was determined at these three areas. Results of the measurements and calculations verify positive effect of shelterbelts consisted in wind velocity decreasing (at about 78% in average), soil humidity increasing (at about 102% in average) and soil resistance increasing (at about 70% in average) at the leeward side of the shelterbelts.

AB  - As a result of recent surface water quality problems in North Carolina, riparian buffers and controlled drainage are being used to reduce the loss of nonpoint source nitrogen from agricultural fields. The effect of controlled drainage and riparian buffers as best management practices to reduce the loss of agricultural nonpoint source nitrogen from the middle coastal plain has not been well documented. The middle coastal plain is characterized by intensive agriculture on sandy soils with deeply incised or channelized streams. A 2-year study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of controlled drainage, riparian buffers, and a combination of both in the middle coastal plain of North Carolina. It was hypothesized that raising the water table near the ditch would enhance nitrate-nitrogen reduction through denitrification. On the sandy Soils Studied, controlled drainage did not effectively raise the water table near the ditch to a greater degree than observed on the free drainage treatment. Due to random treatment location, the free drainage treatment was installed along a ditch with a shallower impermeable layer compared to the impermeable layer on the controlled drainage treatments (2 m versus 3- to 4-m deep). This resulted in a perched or higher water table on the free drainage treatment. Over 17 storm events, the riparian buffer (free drainage) treatment had an average groundwater table depth of 0.92 in compared to 0.96 and 1.45 in for the combination (riparian buffer and controlled drainage) and controlled drainage treatments, respectively. Nitrate concentration decrease between the field wells and ditch edge wells averaged 29% (buffer only), 63% (buffer and controlled drainage), and 73% (controlled drainage only). Although apparently more nitrate was removed from the groundwater on the controlled drainage treatments, the controlled drainage treatment water table near the ditch was not raised closer to the ground surface compared to the free drainage treatment. Nitrate removal effectiveness was attributed to local soil and landscape properties, Such as denitrification in deeper reduced zones of the soil profile.

AB  - Abstract: To minimize the risk posed by runoff from row crops, Prince Edward Island introduced buffer legislation in 2000. The legislation mandates 10-m and 20-m buffers, respectively, for moderate sloped (i.e. <5%) and steep sloped (i.e. >5%) agricultural fields that border streams. Since 2001, Environment Canada has been evaluating the effectiveness of various buffer widths on operational farms in reducing toxicity and contaminant concentrations in runoff. Sample collectors, placed in 44 fields at the field edge (0m), 10m and at distances out to 30m, collected overland flow following rainfall-induced runoff events. Samples were collected within 24 hours of an event and analysed for seven pesticides (endosulfan, chlorothalonil, carbofuran, linuron, metribuzin, metalaxyl, mancozeb), water quality parameters and Daphnia magna toxicity. The 10-m buffer required for moderate sloped fields was effective at reducing contaminant concentrations but not always to less than lethal concentrations to Daphnia magna. Limited data beyond 10m for fields of both slope types precluded making recommendations on a suitable buffer width for shallow sloped fields and evaluating the effectiveness of 20-m buffers for steep sloped fields. When paired data were combined and statistically tested for all fields, the studied pesticides underwent a 52-98% and 68-100% reduction in aqueous and particulate concentrations within 10m and 30m, respectively. In addition, by 10m, soluble phosphorus, nitrate-nitrogen and total suspended solids were reduced by 34%, 38% and 64%, respectively. Results suggest buffer zones on operational farms are capable of achieving contaminant reductions comparable to those reported for controlled experiments. Inconsistent siting of sample collectors beyond 10m limited the evaluation of the effects of field slope and buffer width on buffer effectiveness on working farms. Future studies on buffer efficiency on operational farms should focus on building the data set beyond 10m and evaluating load reductions.

AB  - Abstract: The Eurasian woodcock (Scolopax rusticola) is a game species experiencing high hunting pressure, long-term modifications of its habitats, and with questions regarding its current conservation status. Winter is a season of highest concentration of birds and hunting pressure but woodcock precise habitat requirements are poorly known. It is crucial to assess threats and to develop sustainable management options for the conservation of woodcock populations. During three consecutive winters, we monitored 65 individual woodcocks fitted with radio-tags in Brittany, France. Habitat selection was analysed using GIS and compositional analysis, in relation to vegetation types, soil variables (humus types) and the abundance of their main prey (earthworms). Woodcocks used different habitats diurnally and nocturnally, generally preferring areas with high earthworm biomass. Diurnal habitat selection in forests was associated with humus type (preference for mulls, rich in earthworms) and dense shrub strata (better protection). Hedges with a high density of trees and shrub were also important habitat. At night, grazed meadows were the preferred habitat, containing five times higher biomass of earthworms compared to cultivated fields. Sustainable management of populations requires protection and management of habitats that incorporates food and cover. Forestry practices should preserve rich humus types and coppices by choosing tree species that ameliorate the soil and soil tilling. Changes in landscapes and intensive agricultural practices are current threats to woodcock populations: destruction of hedges, decrease of permanent grazed meadows, impoverishment of soils fauna biomasses from ploughing and chemical applications. However, woodcocks may benefit from the recent development of set-asides, grass field-borders and simplified farm practices (no-tillage and direct sowing).

AB  - Radiotelemetry was used to study the movement of 32 black rat snakes (Elaphe o. obsoleta) at Remington Farms, Maryland, during 1988-89 to determine potential ways to minimize their predation on nesting birds and small mammals. Decreasing habitat suitability is suggested as a solution by creating broad expanses of unsuitable habitat bordering forests, or maintaining large forest blocks with a low edge-to-area ratio.

AB  - Eriborus terebrans (Gravenhorst) is the most abundant parasitoid of the European cornborer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), in Michigan. The within-field distribution of adult E, terebrans was sampled in 1991 and 1992 by placing malaise traps near a wooded edge, near an herbaceous edge, and in the field interior in each of 4 fields of corn, Zea mays L. During the 1st generation of 1991, significantly more females were captured in wooded-edge traps than in herbaceous-edge or interior traps. In the Ist generation of 1992, more females were again captured in wooded-edge traps in 2 fields, whereas in the other 2 fields, more were captured in both herbaceous-edge and wooded-edge traps than interior traps. In the 2nd generation of both years, there was no consistent pattern of distribution of adult females among sites. The distribution pattern of adult females among fields was not consistently correlated with the distribution of O. nubilalis larvae or percentage parasitism. Overall, fen er males were captured than females, and in the Ist generation of both years, more males were captured near wooded edges of cornfields in which the previous crop had been corn, than any other sites. Both male and female E, terebrans were captured in malaise traps at the interface of a woodlot canopy and a cornfield with capture zones from 1 to 4.3 m high. We propose that E. terebrans distribution in cornfields is influenced by resources such as sugar and a moderate microclimate present in adjacent woodlots but unavailable in early-season cornfields. Perennial noncrop habitats may play an important role in conservation of natural enemies for biological control.

AB  - Computer simulation models are regarded as important tools to address concerns about the environmental impact of agricultural activities and have increasingly been used to complement field research. The CERES-Maize and CROPGRO-Soybean, two of the main crop growth models incorporated into the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), were developed to simulate the effects of environmental conditions, different management strategies, and genetics on crop growth and development. These models currently do not have an option for calculating erosion and phosphorus (P) dynamics. In this study, the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) and sediment-bound P model were incorporated into CERES-Maize and CROPGRO-Soybean models. The evapotranspiration component of the CERES model was also evaluated to test the ability of the model to simulate the effects of shelterbelts on corn transpiration. Two years of sap flow data collected from corn plants in a sheltered (3H) and unsheltered (25H) areas in a field near Ogden, Iowa, were used for model testing. Results showed that the CERES-Maize model simulated daily plant transpiration well in both sheltered and unsheltered areas with RMSE of 0.53mm d -1 (3H) and 0.75mm d-1 (25H) in 2001, and 0.85mm d-1 (3H) and 0.59mm d-1 (25H) in 2002. Average coefficient of determination (r2 ) for 2001 and 2002 was 0.90 and 0.73, respectively. After erosion and sediment-bound P subroutines were incorporated into CERES-Maize and CROPGRO-Soybean, the models were calibrated and tested using five years of data collected from two field sites in a watershed in Tama County, Iowa. Results showed that generally both models tended to over or underpredict daily sediment and sediment-bound P losses from fields, but they simulated seasonal values reasonably well. For CERES model, the error between simulated and measured seasonal sediment losses was less than 10% in three out of the five years, while in four out of the five years, the difference between simulated and measured sediment loss was less than 15% for the CROPGRO. The study indicated that both models did not seem to give good estimates of daily sediment and P losses, but they can be used to simulate the long-term (seasonal) losses with reasonable accuracy.

AB  - Most field margins on arable land in Switzerland are narrow and intensively managed. As a consequence, field margins generally harbour few plant and animal species. To enhance biodiversity in arable landscapes, sown species-rich field margins, so-called improved field margins, were introduced in 2008 as a part of the Swiss agri-environment scheme. Here, we tested whether improved field margins increase slug activity density. Slug activity density in and next to improved field margins was compared to slug activity in and next to conventional field margins. Over a period of 3 years, slugs were sampled in three regions in northern Switzerland in late spring using bait stations. Our results show that improved field margins have higher slug activity density, of +191 %, than conventional field margins, independently of the region. The predominant slugs were Arion lusitanicus and Deroceras spp. While A. lusitanicus was generally more abundant in field margins than in fields, with intermediate numbers in the adjacent crop margins, Deroceras spp. showed a more even distribution.

AB  - Runoff losses of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from field applied manure can contribute to surface water pollution. Grass hedges may reduce runoff losses of nutrients and sediment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of narrow switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) hedges (-0.75 m wide) on the transport of P and N from a field receiving beef cattle feedlot manure under tilled and no-till conditions. This study was conducted on a steep (12% average slope) Monona silt loam fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls) soil near Treynor, Iowa. The experiment was a split-plot with no-till and disked systems as main plots and subplots of manure, fertilizer, and check with or without a grass hedge. A rainfall simulator was used and runoff was collected from both the initial and the following wet simulations. Only 38% of the no-till plots and 63% of disked plots had any runoff during the initial 6.4 cm hr -1 water application. A single narrow grass hedge reduced runoff concentrations of dissolved P (DP) by 47%, bioavailable P (BAP) by 48%, particulate P (PP) by 38%, total P (TP) by 40%, and NH 4-N by 60% during the wet simulation on the no-till plots receiving manure, compared with similar plots with no hedges. The corresponding reductions in concentrations as a result of a grass hedge for DP, BAP, PP, TP, and NH 4-N on the disked plots were 21, 29, 43, 38, and 52%, respectively. Runoff NH 4-N concentration from fertilizer applied to the disked plots was reduced by 61%, NO 3-N by 21%, and total N (TN) by 27% during the wet simulation when grass hedges were used. Grass hedges also reduced total quantities of DP, BAP, TP, and NH 4-N during the wet simulation. The TP loss was 3.3% of applied fertilizer and was 0.3% of applied manure P. Narrow grass hedges were effective in reducing P and N losses in runoff from both manure and fertilizer application.

AB  - Local species richness of butterflies can be expected to benefit from both local habitat properties as well as the availability of suitable habitats and source populations in the surrounding landscape. Whether local species richness is dependent on local or landscape factors can be assessed by examining the relationship between local and landscape species richness. Here we studied how local species richness is related to landscape-level species richness in landscapes differing in agricultural intensity. The relationship was linear for field boundaries in intensively cultivated landscapes and non-linear in less-intensively cultivated landscapes. In landscapes containing semi-natural grasslands (on average 4% of overall land-use), the relationship was non-linear for field boundaries, but linear when considering local species richness of the grasslands themselves. These results show that local factors are more important than landscape factors in determining local species richness in landscapes which contained semi-natural grasslands. Local species richness was limited by landscape factors in intensively cultivated landscapes. This interpretation was supported by the relationship between local species richness and landscape-scale average mobility and generalist percentage of butterfly assemblages. We conclude that the management of field boundary habitat quality for butterflies is expected to be most effective in landscapes with semi-natural grasslands, the species composition of which in turn is dependent on the regional occurrence of grasslands. Based on our results, managing non-crop habitats for the conservation of habitat specialists and species with poor mobility will be most efficient in regions where patches of semi-natural grasslands occur.

AB  - This study examined how field boundary habitat quality and farming system (organic or conventional) affect species richness and abundance of diurnal lepidopterans and bumblebees in boreal agricultural landscapes. The results showed positive effects of field boundary area on lepidopteran diversity, as well as positive effects of nectar flower abundance on lepidopterans and bumblebee abundance. Organic farming did not show any significant effects on lepidopteran diversity. The results suggested that a successful conservation strategy for lepidopterans occurring in boreal agroecosystems depend on proper management of field boundaries, irrespective of farming regime. As bumblebee diversity tended to be higher at organic plots it is concluded that these important pollinators might be able to react on even small changes in habitat quality of cultivated lands. The results concord with a general hypothesis that effects of organic farming might be overpowered by effects of landscape structure in heterogeneous landscapes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Riparian buffer strip guidelines are under scrutiny in the River Njoro Watershed in Kenya. This study investigated soil properties (bulk density, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) in different land use types (small scale agriculture in recent settlements, mixed agriculture in established peri-urban settlements, large-scale commercial agriculture, and the gazetted forest reference condition) and their adjacent buffer strips. Bulk density, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus within 30-m riparian buffer strips adjacent to recent settlement land use areas were similar to those of the gazetted forest reference condition, but only bulk density of the buffer strips adjacent to peri-urban and commercial agriculture land use areas were similar to the gazetted forest reference condition. Phosphorus is a sensitive indicator of the impacts of human activity, as increased concentrations were observed with increasing scale of land use activity. For riparian buffers adjacent to recent settlements, soil phosphorus was significantly higher in buffers narrower than 30 m (5.01 mg P kg(-1)) than gazetted forest (3.40 mg P kg(-1)) but not significantly different for riparian buffers wider than 30 m (3.81 mg P kg(-1)) compared to gazetted forest. Based on the research, it is recommended that policies governing riparian buffer strips become (1) stricter, with the current "maximum" of 30 m considered a minimum; and (2) adaptive, with 30 m used in small-scale agricultural areas, and wider riparian buffer strips used in medium- and large-scale agricultural areas.

AB  - Swine (Sus scrofa) wastewater was applied to three separate 4 m wide x 30 m long riparian filterstrips consisting of 20 m grass and 10 m forest, 10 m grass and 20 m forest, and 10 m grass and 20 m maidencane (Panicum hemitomon Schult.) in Southern Georgia during each season. Total and fecal Coliform numbers in the applied wastewater pulse did not decline as water moved downslope regardless of vegetation type or season. The pulse of applied wastewater did not move beyond 15 m in any treatment in autumn or summer (dry seasons) and only moved beyond 7.5 m in the 20 m grass-10 m forest treatment in the summer. Total and fecal coliform numbers in soil water and shallow ground water declined by approximately 10-fold every 7 d for the first 14 d regardless of vegetative treatment or season. Soil temperature and soil moisture correlated with total coliform bacteria in both 1.5 m wells (r2 = 0.89) and 2.0 m wells (r2 = 0.89), and with fecal coliform bacteria in 1.5 (r2 = 0.82) and 2.0 m (r2 = 0.76) wells. Animal production operations may need to locate in warm- dry climates so animal waste can be applied to lands to help ensure enteric bacteria input to surface and ground water will not occur.

AB  - Abstract: In the context of rapid and severe biodiversity decline in agroecosystems, the European Union has introduced agri-environmental schemes. However, these schemes require evaluation to estimate their efficiency, for further consolidation and improvement. The establishment of grassy strips along watercourses represents a measure of cross-compliance introduced in France in 2005. In this study, we analyzed the benefits of these new landscape elements for biodiversity, by (i) exploring the plant community composition of grassy strips in relation to their landscape context, (ii) analyzing the faunal communities of three major functional groups (i.e., small mammals, syrphids, and carabid beetles) present in grassy strips of agroecosystems, (iii) comparing the faunal biodiversity to that observed in other habitats of agroecosystems, such as fields and hedgerows, and (iv) investigating the relationships between faunal community indices and grassy strip properties. The results of our study showed that the plant community of grassy strips is mainly influenced by semi-natural habitats that are present within a landscape context, i.e., at a scale >500m. We found that grassy strips do not necessarily present areas of particularly high animal biodiversity compared to other habitats (i.e., fields and hedgerows). However, the properties of these strips (i.e., length, width and plant biodiversity) influence the structure of faunal communities. Two years after the establishment of grassy strips, their role as ecotones between previous field margins (mostly hedgerows in our study site) is illustrated through the response of the fauna. Hence, grassy strips, being more stable than cultivated fields, contribute to a new refuge within the agroecosystem landscape.

AB  - Capsule: The loss of hedgerows may have reduced the quality of agricultural land for breeding Swallows. Aims: To test if foraging Swallows select vegetated field boundaries in preference to field centres, if selection is influenced by weather conditions and local habitat type, and if patterns of selection are explained by differences in food availability between the two habitats. Methods: Data were collected from paired vegetated field boundaries and field centres in lowland mixed farmland during good and bad weather conditions. The maximum number of foraging Swallows, total foraging time, food availability and local habitat type (adjacent crop type, presence/absence of boundary trees and boundary height) were recorded. Results: Foraging Swallows selected vegetated boundaries in bad weather and there was a non-significant trend towards selection during good weather. Hedgerow use increased significantly when the adjacent field was winter wheat, rather than grazed grass. Hedgerows containing trees were used more during good weather, but the strength of the effect is less than that of crop type. The habitat types selected by foraging Swallows were almost always those where measured food availability was the highest. Conclusion: Vegetated field boundaries are an important foraging habitat for Swallows and support higher prey densities than field centres, especially when adjacent fields are arable. The loss of hedgerows from agricultural areas, particularly arable ones, may have reduced the quality of farmland as Swallow foraging habitat. An increase in hedgerows and the number of hedgerow trees may improve the quality of farmland as foraging habitat, especially in arable-dominated areas. The effects of this on breeding success and subsequent population trends should be assessed.

AB  - We coordinated a large-scale evaluation of northern bobwhite ( Colinus virginianus) population response to establishment of 9-m to 37-m linear patches (buffers) of native herbaceous vegetation along row-crop field margins as part of the Conservation Reserve Program practice Habitat Buffers for Upland Birds (CP33). We compared northern bobwhite covey densities on 1,088 paired row-crop fields with and without native herbaceous buffers in 13 states during autumn, 2006-2008. We used a 2-stage random effects modeling approach that incorporates the effective area as an offset in generalized linear mixed models to assess regional relationships among autumn bobwhite covey densities and covariates of field type (i.e., fields with vs. without native herbaceous buffers), ecological region, year, survey week, and contracted vegetative cover (i.e., planting native grasses and forbs vs. establishing through natural regeneration). Covey density was correlated with year and interaction effects of field type and ecological region. The year effect suggested annual variation in covey densities, whereas the field type by ecological region interaction suggested covey response to buffers was dependent on spatial location, likely reflecting differences in buffer establishment, succession, and characteristics of the surrounding landscape among regions. Mean fitted covey density on fields across all survey sites was 0.047 (±0.008 bootstrap standard error [BSE]) and 0.031 coveys/ha (±0.003 BSE) on row-crop fields with and without herbaceous buffers, respectively. Covey density was greater on fields with buffers relative to matched, comparison fields without buffers in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (241%; P < 0.001) and both the eastern (123%; P < 0.001) and western (60%; P = 0.01) portions of the Southeastern Coastal Plain region. Covey density was an order of magnitude greater in the central Texas region compared to other regions, but exhibited a small response to native herbaceous buffers, as did density of coveys in the Eastern Tallgrass Prairie and Central Hardwoods regions. Disproportionate response to buffers in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley and Southeastern Coastal Plain suggests native herbaceous habitats might be limiting during autumn in these regions, whereas lack of response in the Eastern Tallgrass Prairie, Central Hardwoods, and central Texas regions suggests that herbaceous habitat either was not limiting or buffers failed to provide adequate requirements for bobwhites during autumn. Selection of other habitats to meet security and thermoregulatory needs might have resulted in lack of response in these regions. Native herbaceous cover provided by buffers can provide critical habitat in row-crop agricultural systems in some regions, and can contribute to regional population recovery objectives of the Northern Bobwhite Conservation Initiative (NBCI). However, range-wide NBCI recovery objectives will best be met through multiple conservation practices in row-crop agricultural systems. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Mounting evidence of wildlife population gains from targeted conservation practices has prompted the need to develop and evaluate practices that are integrated into production agriculture systems and targeted toward specific habitat objectives. However, effectiveness of targeted conservation actions across broader landscapes is poorly understood. We evaluated multiregion, multispecies avian densities on row-crop fields with native grass field margins (i.e., buffers) as part of the first U.S. agricultural conservation practice designed to support habitat and population recovery objectives of a national wildlife conservation initiative. We coordinated breeding season point transect surveys for 6 grassland bird species on 1151 row-crop fields with and without native grass buffers (9-37 m) in 14 U.S. states (10 ecoregions) from 2006 to 2011. In most regions, breeding season densities of 5 of 6 targeted bird species were greater in the 500-m surrounding survey points centered on fields with native grass buffers than in landscapes without buffers. Relative effect sizes were greatest for Northern Bobwhite ( Colinus virginianus), Dickcissel ( Spiza americana), and Field Sparrow ( Spizella pusilla) in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley and Eastern Tallgrass Prairie regions. Other species (e.g., Eastern Meadowlark [ Sturnella magna], Grasshopper Sparrow [ Ammodramus savannarum]) exhibited inconsistent relative effect sizes. Bird densities on fields with and without buffers were greatest in the Central Mixed-grass Prairie region. Our results suggest that strategic use of conservation buffers in regions with the greatest potential for relative density increases in target species will elicit greater range-wide population response than diffuse, uninformed, and broadly distributed implementation of buffers. We recommend integrating multiple conservation practices in broader agricultural landscapes to maximize conservation effectiveness for a larger suite of species. Evaluación de los Beneficios de la Mutliregionalidad de Aves a Partir de Amortiguadores Agriculturales Estratégicamente Señalados (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Resumen La creciente evidencia de aumentos en la población de vida silvestre, obtenida de prácticas de conservación objetivo, ha provocado la necesidad de desarrollar y evaluar a las prácticas que se integran a la producción de los sistemas agrícolas y se han enfocado en objetivos específicos de hábitat. Sin embargo, la efectividad de las acciones de la conservación a través de terrenos más amplios es poco entendida. Evaluamos la densidad multiregión y multiespecie de aves en campos de cultivos en hilera con márgenes de pastizal nativo (es decir, amortiguadores) como parte de la primera práctica de conservación agrícola en los EUA, diseñada para apoyar a los objetivos de recuperación de hábitat y de población de una iniciativa nacional de conservación de vida silvestre. Coordinamos censos de transecto de punto en temporada de reproducción para 6 especies de aves de pastizal en 1151 campos de cultivos en hilera con y sin amortiguadores de pastizal nativo (9-37 m), en 14 estados de los EUA (10 ecoregiones) desde 2006 hasta 2011. En la mayoría de las regiones, las densidades de temporada de reproducción de 5 de las 6 especies objetivo fueron mayores en los 500 m alrededor de los puntos de muestreo centrados en los campos con amortiguadores de pastizal nativo que en los terrenos sin amortiguadores. Los tamaños de efecto relativo fueron mayores para Colinus virginianus, Spiza americana y Spizella pusilla en las regiones del Valle Aluvial del Mississippi y la Pradera Oriental de Hierbas Altas. Otras especies (p. ej.: Sturnella magna y Ammodramus savannarum) exhibieron tamaños de efecto relativo irregulares. Las densidades de aves en campos con y sin amortiguadores fueron mayores en la región de la Pradera Central de Hierbas Mixtas. Nuestros resultados sugieren que el uso estratégico de amortiguadores de conservación en regiones con el mayor potencial para incrementos en la densidad rel tiva en especies objetivo provocará una mayor respuesta de población de rango extenso que la implementación de amortiguadores difusa, mal informada y distribuida en general. Recomendamos integrar múltiples prácticas de conservación en terrenos agrícolas más amplios para maximizar la efectividad de la conservación para un conjunto mayor de especies.

AB  - ABSTRACT Native herbaceous vegetation cover along row-crop field edges (i.e., field buffers) increases breeding densities of many bird species. However, the effect of field buffers on bird species during the non-breeding season is less understood. We compared density, avian richness, and avian conservation value on row-crop fields containing buffers strategically designed for wildlife versus fields without buffers in 3 southeastern U.S. states during winter 2007 and 2008. Fields with buffers were enrolled in U.S. Department of Agriculture, Conservation Reserve Program practice Habitat Buffers for Upland Birds (CP33), which targets restoration of northern bobwhite ( Colinus virginianus) and other upland bird species. Overall species richness did not differ on fields with buffers versus fields without buffers in 2007, but was 29% greater on fields with buffers in 2008. Swamp sparrows ( Melospiza georgiana), song sparrows ( M. melodia), field sparrows ( Spizella pusilla), and red-bellied woodpeckers ( Melanerpes carolinus) had greater densities on fields with buffers compared with fields without buffers. Increasing field-buffer width did not result in greater bird densities. Our results suggest a small change in primary land use (≈7%) produced a disproportionate population response by some grassland-dependent and woodland bird species during winter. Because field buffers provide a direct source of winter food and cover resources, they may be a pragmatic means to provide critical non-breeding habitat with little alteration of existing agricultural systems. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - In this study results from land managed by volunteer members of the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust's Partridge Count Scheme (PCS) were used to determine how well Environmental Stewardship (ES) and its predecessor schemes have performed for one intensively studied farmland bird, the grey partridge (Perdix perdix) between 2005 and 2008. The individual agri-environmental scheme (AES) options that PCS members chose to implement were classified into groups based on the habitat that they provide for grey partridges at different stages of their life cycle. Three groups of options had consistently positive effects beetle banks, conservation headlands and wild bird cover, all in-field options. Options with consistently negative effects were those including grass and scrub management. Unfortunately for grey partridges, beetle banks and conservation headlands currently have very little uptake within AES: of non-PCS agreements 1.9% include beetle banks and 2% conservation headlands. Non-PCS agreements have a slightly higher uptake of wild bird cover (12.9%). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of a land consolidation project were studied in an agricultural landscape in Brittany on the foraging habitats, breeding parameters and factors causing breeding failure of the linnet Acanthis cannabina L. The study covered five breeding seasons before land consolidation and another five afterwards. The project involved the disappearance of more than 50% of the hedgerows, and about 30% of the meadows and fallow lands were replaced by cultivation. Before land consolidation, breeding success was mainly affected by density-dependent factors, whereas afterwards density-independent factors such as weather or disease played an important role. The preferred feeding sites remained the same during the whole study period; fallow lands, rape fields and meadows were selected positively but cereal and potato fields were avoided. This characteristic became more apparent after land consolidation, because it involved a reduction in the feeding areas of the linnet. Numbers of eggs per clutch, hatchlings and fledglings were unaffected but fledging and breeding success of the first brood increased significantly during this period. Predation, which was the main cause of egg loss and nestling mortality, decreased significantly after land consolidation, through loss of hedges used as movement corridors by some specialist predators. The increase in the distance between breeding site and foraging area probably reduced the time spent by adults on their nests, leaving nestlings unprotected.

AB  - Four fields (three organic and one conventionally managed) in an intensive vegetable producing landscape in eastern England were sampled for ground beetles in 2005 and 2006, using pitfall traps, to investigate species activity and species assemblage distribution within five crop and three field margin types. In addition, non-crop ditch sites were also sampled. Three species assemblages in the fields were strongly related to crop type, with two others consisting of non-crop sites, one dominated by field margins, the other by ditch sites. Species activity and richness in fields were also strongly, and significantly, associated with crop type, with most in organic Brassica crops (cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli), less in organic leeks and least in conventional calabrese. Some species were significantly more active in weedier fields but others preferred more open ground. Considerably more species were recorded from first-year planted field margins, with fewest species active in unplanted margins. Activity was also relatively low in densely vegetated second-year margins. There appeared to be little relationship between species activity in the margins and that in the crop fields. Ground beetle species are important for the predation of cabbage root fly eggs in Brassica crops, especially in organic fields. In order to enhance and maximise appropriate ground beetle species activity and predation within vegetable fields, it is likely that management within both fields and margins would be required, as well as some method for increasing movement of predators from margins into fields.

AB  - Activity of 12 beneficial invertebrate groups was assessed in 2005 and 2006 on a farm in northern England split into conventional and organic management halves, using pitfall and pan traps set in both crops and field boundaries. Management, crop and boundary structure influences on invertebrate activity were assessed, as was the relationship between crop and boundary type. Classification of crop and boundary assemblages produced three and two groups, respectively, in both years. Organic arable crops had well-defined assemblages in both years; and, while grass and grass/clover fields were separated from conventional arable fields in 2005, there was mixing in 2006. One boundary group, in both years, was dominated by conventional arable fields with tall herbaceous boundary vegetation. The other group had more organic arable and grassy fields with shorter boundary vegetation. Redundancy analyses showed that a number of groups (Cantharidae, Coccinellidae, Syrphidae, Ichneumonidae, Braconidae, Proctotrupoidea, Lycosidae) were more active in organic arable fields with more Staphylinidae in conventional arable crops and no obvious trend with Carabidae, Hemiptera, Neuroptera and Linyphiidae. Activity of some groups, especially Coccinellidae, Syrphidae and parasitic wasps, was strongly related to weed cover. Staphylinidae were most active in tall herbaceous boundaries by conventional arable crops with more of a number of groups (Cantharidae, Coccinellidae, parasitic wasps) in short herbaceous boundaries by organic arable crops. Organic management produced most differences in aerially-dispersed invertebrates, and management had a profound effect on activity in field boundaries. Possible management prescriptions to increase invertebrate activity include changing sowing times, weed cover manipulation and field boundary and margin management.

AB  - Abstract: Ground beetles were sampled in nine crops and four field boundary types on a split conventional/organic farm in northern England in the five years 2005–2009. Multivariate analyses indicated that a combination of crop type, management and boundary type influenced ground beetle species and group activity. Short vegetation boundaries with bare ground had similar activity, mainly of small species, to that in organic arable crops, contrasting with activity in conventional arable and more densely vegetated boundaries. Large, medium-sized, herbivorous and Collembola feeding species all had considerable activity in oilseed rape and activity was generally greatest in conventional arable crops but least in conventional grass. Disturbance and productivity estimations provided basic insights into ground beetle activity. Most small and medium-sized species were found in areas with low productivity but high and low disturbance, respectively. Large and Collembola feeding species were most active in highly productive areas with medium and low disturbance whilst most herbivorous species preferred medium values of both drivers. In crops, species richness was greatest in organic beans and conventional oilseed rape and lowest in conventional grass. There were more species in short vegetation boundaries than in more densely vegetated field edges. There may be potential for the use of productivity and disturbance estimations in the provision of ecosystem services, especially in assessing the conditions required to optimise ground beetle activity for pest control.

AB  - 1. Understanding the environmental factors that structure biodiversity and food webs among communities is central to assess and mitigate the impact of landscape changes. Wildflower strips are ecological compensation areas established in farmland to increase pollination services and biological control of crop pests and to conserve insect diversity. They are arranged in networks in order to favour high species richness and abundance of the fauna. We describe results from experimental wildflower strips in a fragmented agricultural landscape, comparing the importance of landscape, of spatial arrangement and of vegetation on the diversity and abundance of trap-nesting bees, wasps and their enemies, and the structure of their food webs. The proportion of forest cover close to the wildflower strips and the landscape heterogeneity stood out as the most influential landscape elements, resulting in a more complex trap-nest community with higher abundance and richness of hosts, and with more links between species in the food webs and a higher diversity of interactions. We disentangled the underlying mechanisms for variation in these quantitative food web metrics. We conclude that in order to increase the diversity and abundance of pollinators and biological control agents and to favour a potentially stable community of cavity-nesting hymenoptera in wildflower strips, more investment is needed in the conservation and establishment of forest habitats within agro-ecosystems, as a reservoir of beneficial insect populations.

AB  - 1. Hedgerows provide an important habitat for wildlife including invertebrates, representing a large proportion of semi-natural habitat patches in the modern agricultural landscapes of the UK and Europe. Around 40% of hedgerow length in England is managed under agri-environment scheme (AES) options, which specify less frequent cutting and advise cutting in winter. 2. Hedgerow management can alter habitat structure and quality, potentially influencing invertebrate community structure. We assessed the impacts of management treatments on moth communities and their parasitoids. Two treatments ('cutting frequency': once every 1, 2, or 3 years, and ` cutting time': autumn vs. winter) were applied to a long-running hedgerow experiment, mimicking AES prescriptions. Moth larvae were collected from the hedgerows, identified and reared to determine parasitism. Hedgerow structure and foliar quality were quantified and related to changes in moth abundance, diversity, species richness, and parasitism. 3. Hedgerow management did not significantly affect overall abundance of moth larvae, but did affect the abundance of certain feeding guilds and trophic interactions with parasitoids. Concealed moth larvae (mining, tentiform, and case bearing) were more abundant on hedgerows cut infrequently (every 2 or 3 years vs. annually). Parasitism rates were higher on hedgerows cut less often, when these were cut in autumn. There was a strong trend towards greater moth species richness and diversity on winter cut hedgerows. 4. Agri-environment scheme management can thus have complex effects on invertebrate communities. The abundance of some moths may be positively affected by AES hedgerow management and this can have knock-on effects on parasitoid abundance.

AB  - Soil erosion by water is a well-recognized serious environmental problem in the world. While contour hedgerow systems are an effective method for soil water conservation, there are a few studies on its effect in the red soil hilly areas in Southeast China. With a fixed field experiment, we constructed a runoff plot at hilly area in Zhuji County, Zhejiang province, to evaluate the effect of the grass hedgerows in soil water conservation, and to determine the optimized hedgerow patterns. Hemerocallis citrine (HC) and Ophiopogon japonicas (OJ) were selected to build the hedgerows in patterns of one row and two rows. The REE method was used to trace the source of the sediment for a better understanding of the characteristic and mechanism of erosion with hedgerows control. Our results showed that (1) hedgerows reduced erosion and surface runoff by 31.99-67.22% and 15.44-45.11%, respectively; (2) hedgerows delayed the development of rills; (3) hedgerows reduced the soil nutrients loss; (4) hedgerows reshaped the soil physical properties, especially in increasing >0.25. mm water-stable aggregates. Taken together, our results suggest that two-row OJ is the optimized contour hedgerow pattern in the experiment condition, and downward sloping land should have the highest priority to take measures for soil water conservation. This research comprehensively studied the effects and mechanism of contour hedgerows in controlling soil and water loss in red soil hilly areas, Southeast China, so that the practice of soil and water conservation can be implemented more effectively in these areas. © 2015 International Research and Training Centre on Erosion and Sedimentation / the World Association for Sedimentation and Erosion Research.

AB  - Several studies have proven the importance of field margins in sustaining biodiversity and other work has been done on the effect of field management on field margin flora. However few models have been built to predict the effects of field management on the flora. Our project addresses this need for a model capable of predicting the effect of cropping techniques and their timing on the flora of field margins. Primula vulgaris is a biodiversity indicator, characteristic of undisturbed flora and found in field margins and woodlands: its population has been declining for several years. We created a temporal matrix model of P. vulgaris populations on field margins, taking into account the effects of field, field margin and roadside management based on literature and expert knowledge. We then analysed its sensitivity to demographic parameters by comparing lambda (growth rate) sensitivity and elasticity. We compared the management parameter effect using the relative growth rate of the population after 6 years of simulation. Sensitivity analysis to biological parameters showed the importance of adult survival and seed production and germination. Results show that P. vulgaris is particularly sensitive to broad-spectrum herbicides and that other management techniques like early mowing, scything and scrub-killer (diluted broad-spectrum herbicide or specific herbicide) are less aggressive. Our simulations show that management of cash crops in Brittany is too aggressive for P. vulgar-is populations and that 4-5 years of grassland in the adjacent field are necessary to maintain populations.

AB  - Water samples collected in the Mermentau River Basin over several years at Lousiana Department of Environmental Quality monitoring sites contained high levels of total solids and nutrients during the spring that were highly correlated to pre- and post-plant discharges from rice fields. This study was developed to evaluate the potential of selected management practices (MP's) for reducing total solids, nutrients and pesticides from discharge water in order to improve the surface water quality in southwest Louisiana [USA]. Five rice plots located on the Rice Research Station in Crowley, LA represented the different MP's to be evaluated. The five water seeding MP's were: a.1-no till; a.2-water cultivation with 30-day settling; a.3-dry cultivation with clear water planting; a.4-mudding-in with vegetated filter; and b-mudding-in (control). Quality of discharged water from rice fields in the Mermentau River Basin was clearly affected by the different MP's. From the first year of data, all the MPa's were better than the mudding-in (MPb). The concentrations of the total solids (kg/ha) in the discharged water (initial+final drain) for the different MP's were in the order: MPb(4860)>MPa.3(3906)>MPa.4(3412)>MPa.2(3068)>MPa.1(1807). The MPa.3, MPa.4 and MPb had no detectable amounts of pesticides being released. The 30-day holding period (MPa.2), clear water planting (MPa.3) and the mudding-in with vegetated filter (MPa.4) were similar as far as TDS, TSS and TS with the no-till (MPa.1) being the least. The 30-day holding period (MPa.2) and the no-till (MPa.1) had less nutrients, but more pesticides released. Depending on the priority of the stream problems, different MP's may be more advantageous than others. All of the selected MP's were better than the control (MPb), and therefore, should help to improve water quality.

AB  - 1. The abundance and species richness of butterflies on expanded-width uncropped arable field edges, which were subject to 10 contrasting, experimental management regimes, were measured using transects in 1989, 1990 and 1991. The effects of the management regimes on a number of botanical variables, likely to be of importance to butterflies, were measured. 2. On the experimental field edges, butterfly abundance and species richness fluctuated between years and peaked at different times each year. 3. Butterfly abundance and species richness differed between experimental treatments. Plots which were either cut in the spring and autumn, or not cut at all, attracted more individuals and species of butterfly than did plots cut in the summer. Sowing with a grass and wild flower seed mixture increased butterfly abundance. Butterfly abundance declined on swards sprayed once annually with herbicide. 4. Mowing, sowing and spraying had significant effects on mean flower abundance, on the annual and perennial components flowering in the sward, and on the abundance of commonly used nectar sources and larval host-plants. 5. Stepwise multiple regression analyses on butterfly and plant data showed that the abundance of adults of most butterfly species was most closely associated with the abundance of flowers of key nectar source species. 6. The results are discussed in relation to resource provision for larval and adult butterfly stages. Recommendations (emboldened in the text) are made for the conservation management of butterflies on arable farmland.

AB  - Agri-environment measures cover at least 20% of the EU's farmland, a proportion rising to approximately 30% in Ireland. A study, investigating effects on biodiversity of Ireland's Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) is described. Field margin flora and Carabidae (ground beetle) fauna were surveyed on 60 paired agreement and non-agreement farms. Greater variation was observed amongst surveyed non-agreement farms: the most species-rich and species-poor farms were all non-agreement. On surveyed grassland farms, average plant species richness was significantly higher on non-agreement than on agreement farms. Otherwise, few differences between average species richness and abundance on agreement and non-agreement farms were revealed. In ordination analysis of the flora and carabidae data factors largely independent of recent management, such as hedge age and gappiness, were most important in explaining observed variation. The study concluded that the scheme has not significantly benefited the groups surveyed, and suggests that the generic measures in such horizontal schemes may be better suited to addressing landscape-level issues such as water pollution, with biodiversity objectives for high nature value areas being more effectively achieved by targeted zonal schemes. Baseline data and long-term monitoring of measurable objectives are essential for effective evaluation, both to better tailor these innovative schemes to their aims, and to clearly demonstrate their benefits.

AB  - Wild bees provide a free and potentially diverse ecosystem service to farmers growing pollination-dependent crops. While many crops benefit from insect pollination, soft fruit crops, including strawberries are highly dependent on this ecosystem service to produce viable fruit. However, as a result of intensive farming practices and declining pollinator populations, farmers are increasingly turning to commercially reared bees to ensure that crops are adequately pollinated throughout the season. Wildflower strips are a commonly used measure aimed at the conservation of wild pollinators. It has been suggested that commercial crops may also benefit from the presence of noncrop flowers; however, the efficacy and economic benefits of sowing flower strips for crops remain relatively unstudied. In a study system that utilizes both wild and commercial pollinators, we test whether wildflower strips increase the number of visits to adjacent commercial strawberry crops by pollinating insects. We quantified this by experimentally sowing wildflower strips approximately 20 meters away from the crop and recording the number of pollinator visits to crops with, and without, flower strips. Between June and August 2013, we walked 292 crop transects at six farms in Scotland, recording a total of 2826 pollinators. On average, the frequency of pollinator visits was 25% higher for crops with adjacent flower strips compared to those without, with a combination of wild and commercial bumblebees (Bombus spp.) accounting for 67% of all pollinators observed. This effect was independent of other confounding effects, such as the number of flowers on the crop, date, and temperature. Synthesis and applications. This study provides evidence that soft fruit farmers can increase the number of pollinators that visit their crops by sowing inexpensive flower seed mixes nearby. By investing in this management option, farmers have the potential to increase and sustain pollinator populations over time.

AB  - Capsule: Territory density varied between habitat types and displayed a clear relationship with certain macro- and micro-habitat characteristics. Aims: To investigate the role of habitat and structural hedgerow components on breeding densities of Robins and to provide baseline territory density estimates for the Robin in a range of habitats in south-west Ireland. Methods: Robin territory densities were estimated at 39 sites of five major habitat types in southwest Ireland. A modified CBC-type technique was used to census Robins and additional habitat data were collected at each site. One-way ANOVA with post hoc testing was used to investigate the population densities between the different habitat groupings, and a principal component analysis of habitat data was used to generate independent variables for a stepwise regression where territory density per hectare and territory density per kilometre were, in turn, the dependent variables. Results: Population densities varied significantly between habitat types. The highest Robin territory densities were encountered in semi-improved grassland sites and the lowest values in suburban gardens. The mean territory density per hectare in all farmland habitats surveyed was notably higher than published estimates for British farmland and woodland. The quantity of hedgerow available appeared to be an important factor in determining Robin abundance on farmland. There was also a relationship between various hedgerow structural components and Robin territory density. Conclusion: Our analysis indicated that high bushy hedgerows with narrow banks and low basal vegetation positively influenced the number of Robin territories per hectare. We also conclude that if basal vegetation becomes overgrown at some critical point it impedes detection of prey by Robins, even when there are many available foraging perches. © 2006 British Trust for Ornithology.

AB  - Forested riparian corridors exist because of inadvertent habitat fragmentation or purposeful establishment to protect water quality. Previous studies have focused on the extent of a buffer required to prevent nutrient (e.g. phosphorus) enrichment of surface waters through runoff. If forested corridors are to be effective nutrient buffers, it is important to understand the patterns of nutrient deposition in buffer soils and the long-term potential for nutrients leaching via shallow groundwater. The first section of this research focuses on patterns of phosphorus and secondary nutrient enrichment and saturation within forested buffers. By testing soil cores taken across the widths of forested riparian corridors bordering active agricultural fields, I found significant declines in phosphorus concentration and saturation levels after 10m. Phosphorus saturation levels were low to moderate, and none of the buffers I sampled showed a high risk of phosphorus leaching into shallow groundwater. I also found significant declines in base saturation and cation exchange capacity, as well as in the concentrations of calcium, manganese, and potassium as distance from the edge of the buffer increased. These changes suggest that the declines in phosphorus and phosphorus saturation may be due in part to changes in nutrient cycling within the buffer and not entirely due to differential rates of phosphorus deposition. Regardless of the cause of the declining phosphorus concentrations, my data suggest that a forested buffer of 10 m is sufficient under most conditions for the protection of surface waters from phosphorus runoff, though wider buffers may be advisable if active management of the buffer is anticipated. Whether resulting from an effort to protect surface waters or as a natural consequence of human land use patterns, fragmented forested riparian corridors may be the only forest habitat available. As such, they are an opportunity to promote biodiversity within managed ecosystems, and a prime target for efforts to promote biotic integrity. Invasion by non-native plants is one threat to biotic integrity and native biodiversity that is of particular concern in fragmented landscapes. The second section of this research examines the role of corridor width in the exclusion of non-native invasive plants. Some invasive plants, being edge specialists or generalists, have been shown to be less competitive in forest interior habitats. By examining the prevalence of several non-native plants across the forested corridors of varying widths, I determined the extent to which increasing buffer width may help prevent invasive plant domination within corridors and especially along stream banks. While Japanese honeysuckle and multi-flora rose did not significantly decline across corridor widths, Oriental bittersweet and garlic mustard showed strong declines after 20 m. These findings suggest that modest increases in riparian corridor width can have a positive impact on the exclusion of some exotic species from forest interiors and may help to improve the biotic integrity of these habitats.

AB  - The utilisation of 6 m countryside stewardship scheme (CSS) grass margins by butterflies was studied at two farms in Essex between 1997 and 2000. The aim of the study was to establish whether grass margins in cereal fields, as set up and managed under CSS guidelines, would be beneficial to common farmland butterflies. Eight 6 m grass margins (total length 3492 m) and two control sections (no margin; total length 700 m) were monitored over the first years of the agreements using the transect method. Significantly greater total numbers of butterflies and individuals of Maniola jurtina were seen on the 6 m grass margins than on the control sections. There was a significant increase in abundance of Maniola jurtina on the margins over the 4-year study period. Significantly more butterflies and Maniola jurtina were seen on the sown 6 m grass margin next to set-aside than on any of the other methods of establishment. Sown next to set-aside was best for Pyronia tithonus, but not significant.

AB  - Butterfly and plant species richness were recorded from 1997 to 2000 on 2 and 6 m grass margins created at three farms in Essex which had entered the Countryside Stewardship Scheme (CSS) in October 1996. On both the 2 and 6 m margins there was a significant relationship between the length of hedgerow and the number of plant species observed on the margins, but the seed mixtures used may not have been ideal and natural regeneration should not have been used on the clay soils of Essex. Butterfly species richness was significantly greater on the 2 m margins than on the control sections, and was greater when a higher number of grass species were included in the original seed mixture. Plant species richness was greater on the 6 m margins when established by natural regeneration. CSS grass margins could be improved as butterfly habitats if they are linked to existing habitats such as hedgerows, are sown with a better range of native grasses and herbs and are managed in a way more conducive to wildlife. These changes to the policy of establishment of CSS margins could help combat habitat loss and fragmentation within the countryside. © Springer 2006.

Thirteen two metre margins (total length 4478 m) and three sections with no margin (total length 656 m) were monitored over the 4 year period using the transect method. Significantly more Maniola jurtina, Thymelicus sylvestris and Thymelicus lineola were seen on the two metre margins than on the control sections, but there was a significant reduction in abundance of Thymelicus sylvestris, Thymelicus lineola and Ochlodes venata on the margins over the 4 year study period. Only the abundance of Pyronia tithonus increased significantly on the two metre margins over that period.

AB  - The concept and the effects of a multi-purpose grassed waterway (GWW) were investigated over an eight year period. A GWW, half of it seeded, the remainder left to natural succession, and an intensive soil consevation system in the fields nearby were established in an agricultural watershed (13.7 ha). This combination minimized the maintenance in the GWW without sward damaging sedimentation. In consequence the GWW, as well as providing safe drainage for surface runoff, also served additional ecological roles. During the experiment it reduced runoff and sediment delivery from the watershed by 39% and 82%, respectively. Moreover it improved biodiversity on the research farm and acted as a refuge for beneficial organisms. Soil mineral nitrogen content decreased by 84% after the installation of the GWW, indicating that although infiltration into the GWW was rapid, the risk of groundwater contamination from leached nitrate was diminished. The agricultural assets and drawbacks of establishing GWWs were also studied. We showed that the economic returns were more likely to be improved than reduced. Creating the GWW by natural succession had some advantages compared to seeding with grass.

AB  - Grassed waterways (GWWs) drain surface runoff from fields without gullying along the drainageway. Secondary functions include reducing runoff volume and velocity and retaining sediments and harmful substances from adjacent fields. Grass cover (sward)-damaging sedimentation in the GWW is commonly reduced by frequent mowing, but in doing so the effectiveness of the waterway relative to the secondary functions is reduced. Our objectives were to (i) evaluate whether the maintenance of a GWW can be reduced if on-site erosion control is effective, (ii) measure the effectiveness of such a GWW, and (iii) analyze the underlying mechanisms. A long-term (1994-2000) landscape experiment was performed in four watersheds, where two had GWWs for which maintenance was largely neglected. An intensive soil conservation system was established on all fields. Runoff and sediment delivery were continuously measured in the two watersheds with GWWs and in their paired watersheds that were similar, but without GWWs. Runoff was reduced by 90 and 10% for the two sets of paired watersheds, respectively. The different efficiencies of the GWWs resulted from different layouts (doubled width and flat-bottomed vs. v-shaped drainageway). The GWWs reduced sediment delivery by 97 and 77%, respectively, but the sward was not damaged by sedimentation. Grain sizes > 50 mum were settled due to gravity in both GWWs. Smaller grain sizes were primarily settled due to infiltration. which increased with a more effective runoff reduction. In general, the results indicated a high potential of GWWs for reducing runoff volume and velocity, sediments, and agrochemicals coming from agricultural watersheds.

AB  - Abstract: Grassed waterways (GWWs) are a common measure to drain surface runoff from fields without gullying along the drainageway (thalweg). Moreover, they have a great potential to reduce runoff volume and peak discharge rate, especially if they are located in relatively small watersheds typical for many small patterned landscapes in Europe. Due to the flow characteristics in a GWW, an area of shallow sheet flow on the side-slopes and another of concentrated flow along the thalweg can be identified. The runoff control on the side-slopes is comparable to that of vegetative filter strips, which was intensively investigated in many studies. Our objectives were to use experimental field data, modeling and a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the parameters (morphology, soil, vegetation, water input) dominating the concentrated runoff along the thalweg of a GWW, and thus to optimize GWW layout. The experimental data were derived by pumping concentrated inflow to the upstream end of two GWWs (290 and 370m long). The used model is simulating infiltration according to the Philip''s [Adv. Hydrosci. 5 (1969) 215] equation and routing the runoff with a kinematic wave approximation. The experiment showed a great difference in runoff control between the two tested GWWs, e.g. one reduced runoff volume by 90% the other by 49%. The model agreed well with the experimental data. From the sensitivity analysis of the model parameters, it appeared that the main reason for the difference in runoff characteristics was the flat-bottomed compared to more or less v-shaped cross-section of the thalweg. Differences in hydraulic roughness between the tested GWWs were small, but in general hydraulic roughness is a sensitive parameter in runoff control of a GWW, because in case of grass submergence or high runoff velocities grass is bent to the ground, and hence the hydraulic roughness drops drastically. Soil conditions are only prominent if higher saturated conductivities were assumed than measured at the test site. For colluvial soils typically found where GWWs are established similar efficiencies in runoff control can be expected for similar inflow hydrographs. In general, a high potential of GWWs to reduce runoff volume and peak discharge could be verified within the examined scope of site conditions.

AB  - Abstract: Grassed waterways (GWWs) with large hydraulic roughness exhibit a great potential to reduce runoff, sediments and pollutants coming from agricultural watersheds. For conservation planning the knowledge of overall effectiveness and its seasonal variation is highly relevant. Our objectives were to (i) evaluate the seasonal variation in runoff reduction and sediment trapping in a GWW, (ii) identify the driving parameters and (iii) measure and analyse the seasonal variation of each of these parameters. Runoff and sediment delivery were measured between 1994 and 2001 in two paired subwatersheds, both optimised to reduce runoff and sediment delivery by an intensive soil conservation system within the fields. In one of the subwatersheds additionally a GWW (290m long, 37m wide) was established to further improve soil and water conservation. During the observation period it reduced runoff and sediment delivery by 87 and 93%, respectively. 70% of total outflow and 68% of total sediment output occurred between February and April, mainly controlled by watershed hydrology. Seasonal changes in GWW properties, namely soil water content and hydraulic roughness, had a minor effect. It was most notably in May and June, when available field capacity averaged 59% while inflow was dominated by single heavy rain events (15% of total inflow). In general, the results indicate the high potential of GWWs for reducing runoff and sediment delivery, especially if combined with an intensive soil and water conservation system in the draining fields. For conservation planning, the least effectiveness at the end of winter should be taken into account.

AB  - A modified type of grassed waterway (GWW) with large hydrodynamic roughness has proven ability to reduce sediment load and Surface runoff under conditions where best management practices on the delivering fields reduce sediment inputs that could otherwise damage the grass cover. It is unknown how such a GWW affects the loading of surface runoff with dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP). The effect on DRP was tested in a landscape-scale study where DRP concentrations and loads in surface runoff were measured in two watersheds in which GWWs were newly installed and increased in effectiveness over time. Both watersheds were compared with paired watersheds without GWW installation; all watersheds were continuously monitored over 5 yr (1993-1997). Additionally, DRP concentrations were measured in open field and throughfall precipitation under growing grass and crops in field experiments, and DRP concentrations in surface runoff from straw covered surfaces were determined with laboratory rainfall simulation experiments. Dissolved reactive P in throughfall for the different cover types was highly variable, and the highest concentrations (up to 2.8 mg L(-1)) occurred especially during flowering of the respective crop and after frost events. Dissolved reactive P concentrations in runoff from straw-covered surfaces were slightly higher compared with those from bare soil. On average, there was a small difference in DRP concentrations between throughfall under growing crops and grass and in runoff from bare or straw covered soil surfaces. Hence, the introduction of a relatively small grassed area has little effect on the DRP concentration in surface runoff from the total watershed. This finding was supported by the watershed data, where watersheds with and without GWW showed similar DRP concentrations. No change in DRP concentrations occurred over the 5-yr period. Such GWWs will thus reduce the DRP load analogously to the reduction in total surface runoff.

AB  - Riparian buffers can improve stream water and habitat quality by reducing non-point-source pollution (e. g., nutrients and sediment), increasing canopy cover and thereby reducing water temperature, and contributing allochthonous organic matter (e. g., leaf litter and woody debris). However, the influence of riparian buffers on biotic assemblages in streams is poorly understood, particularly in the Midwestern United States. In this study, we evaluated the effects of riparian buffers on instream habitat, fish assemblage structure, and population characteristics (i. e., the growth of two small-bodied species) in three streams in central Iowa. The streams were surveyed at two spatial scales; specifically, 41 reaches were sampled and 247 macrohabitat types (i. e., pool, riffle, and run) were subsampled in the summer of 2007. Fish assemblage structure data were summarized into separate data sets by the relative abundance of individual species (i. e., fish per minute of electrofishing) and guilds (e. g., trophic and spawning). Multivariate analysis of variance was used to evaluate the differences in instream habitat and fish assemblage structure between areas with and without riparian buffers. The results indicated little to no relationship between the presence of buffers and fish assemblage structure and instream habitat characteristics. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) was used to evaluate the patterns of fish assemblage structure for the reaches and macrohabitat types. The NMS further illustrated the similarity in fish assemblages between buffered and unbuffered reaches. However, the growth of central stonerollers Campostoma anomalum was greatest in unbuffered reaches, while that of creek chub Semotilus atromaculatus was greatest in buffered reaches. Differences in food availability associated with riparian buffers (e. g., increased algal production and decreased terrestrial invertebrate contributions in unbuffered reaches) probably resulted in growth disparities. The results of this study suggest that while riparian buffers have minimal local effects on instream habitat and fish assemblage structure in Iowa streams, they influence instream features (e. g., food availability) that affect fish population dynamics.

AB  - Riparian buffers are important nitrate (NO3-) sinks in agricultural watersheds, but limited information is available regarding the intensity and control of nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from these buffers. This study monitored (December 2009-May 2011) N2O fluxes at two agricultural riparian buffers in the White River watershed in Indiana to assess the impact of land use and hydrogeomorphologic (HGM) attributes on emission. The study sites included a riparian forest in a glacial outwash/alluvium setting (White River [WR]) and a grassed riparian buffer in tile-drained till plains (Leary Weber Ditch [LWD]). Adjacent corn (Zea mays L.) fields were monitored for land use assessment. Analysis of variance identified season, land use (riparian buffer vs. crop field), and site geomorphology as major drivers of N2O fluxes. Strong relationships between N mineralization and N2O fluxes were found at both sites, but relationships with other nutrient cycling indicators (C/N ratio, dissolved organic C, microbial biomass C) were detected only at LWD. Nitrous oxide emission showed strong seasonal variability; the largest N2O peaks occurred in late spring/early summer as a result of flooding at the WR riparian buffer (up to 27.8 mg N2O-N m(-2) d(-1)) and N fertilizer application to crop fields. Annual N2O emission (kg N2O-N ha(-1)) was higher in the crop fields (WR: 7.82; LWD: 6.37) than in the riparian areas. A significant difference (P < 0.02) in annual N2O emission between the riparian buffers was detected (4.32 vs. 1.03 kg N2O-N ha(-1) at WR and LWD, respectively), and this difference was attributed to site geomorphology and flooding (WR is flood prone; no flooding occurred at tile-drained LWD). The study results demonstrate the significance of landscape geomorphology and land-stream connection (i.e., flood potential) as drivers of N2O emission in riparian buffers and therefore argue that an HGM-based approach should be especially suitable for determination of regional N2O budget in riparian ecosystems.

AB  - A hoverfly (Syrphidae) community was investigated in a cultivated wheat field and the adjacent hedgerow near Debrecen (Hungary). We monitored the change of species richness and abundance of hoverflies along three transects in the hedgerow and in the wheat field in different distances (10 m, 20 m) from the hedgerow. The effect of sampling methods on the number of hoverfly species and individuals was analyzed. Two sampling methods were used to catch hoverflies: netting and pan traps. The whole sampling period was divided into three subperiods, which are early (22nd April - 2nd June), middle (11th June - 1st August) and late (6th August - 11th September). Altogether 1,214 individuals of 22 species were sampled. Fourteen species with 78% of individuals belonged to the aphidophagous group, feeding on aphids as larvae. Altogether 861 individuals of 22 hoverfly species were sampled by netting and 353 individuals of 10 species by pan traps. The total number of hoverfly species was significant lower in the late period than in the early. The total abundance was higher in the middle period compared to the early. The species richness and abundance of aphidophagous species followed a similar pattern as the total species values. The species richness and abundance of hoverflies were significant higher in 10 m and 20 m distance in the wheat field than along the hedgerow. The results suggest that the pan traps were less efficient in the hedgerow than the netting, but in the wheat field they sampled more hoverflies because of visually alluring effect on hoverflies in the absence of flowers.

AB  - Outcrosses from genetically modified (GM) to conventional crops by pollen-mediated gene flow (PMGF) are a concern when growing GM crops close to non-GM fields. This also applies to the experimental releases of GM plants in field trials. Therefore, biosafety measures such as isolation distances and surveying of PMGF are required by the regulatory authorities in Switzerland. For two and three years, respectively, we monitored crop-to-crop PMGF from GM wheat field trials in two locations in Switzerland. The pollen donors were two GM spring wheat lines with enhanced fungal resistance and a herbicide tolerance as a selection marker. Seeds from the experimental plots were sampled to test the detection method for outcrosses. Two outcrosses were found adjacent to a transgenic plot within the experimental area. For the survey of PMGF, pollen receptor plots of the conventional wheat variety Frisal used for transformation were planted in the border crop and around the experimental field up to a distance of 200 m. Although the environmental conditions were favorable and the donor and receptor plots flowered at the same time, only three outcrosses were found in approximately 185,000 tested seedlings from seeds collected outside the experimental area. All three hybrids were found in the border crop surrounding the experimental area, but none outside the field. We conclude that a pollen barrier (border crop) and an additional isolation distance of 5 m is a sufficient measure to reduce PMGF from a GM wheat field trial to cleistogamous varieties in commercial fields below a level that can be detected.

AB  - In hedged landscapes, the hedge structure induces a modification of soil organization at the landscape scale and another modification of soil geometry and properties at the slope scale. In these environments, the effects of landscape structures on soil pedogenesis and properties are identified, yet the time scale on which the target processes are occurring remains unknown. The aim of this paper is to constrain the space and time changes in hedge structure, within a historical hedged landscape, in order to better quantify the dynamics of A-horizons geometry. To achieve this goal, we implemented various relative methods (soil geometry analysis, historical document analysis) and absolute methods ((14)C, (137)CS). Results highlight the complexity of soil spatial organization within the landscape: A-horizon geometry is clearly influenced by landscape structures, whereas deeper horizons appear not to be influenced by these structures. The explanatory factors of this current organization are not only the present topography and hedgerow network pattern, but also the position of former hedgerows. Organo-mineral horizon changes clearly post-date the establishment of the hedgerow network landscape, which has controlled topsoil horizon geometry. Since 1833, the decrease in hedgerow network density has changed the spatial distribution of soil redistributions through diffusive transport (including tillage translocation) and water erosion processes; locally, it has increased soil erosion processes with respect to the increase in uphill drainage surface areas without changing general soil organization at the landscape scale acquired over the longer term.

AB  - Abstract: Hedgerow network landscapes or “bocages” are present throughout a large part of Western Europe [Baudry, J., Bunce, R.G.H. et al., 2000. Hedgerows: an international perspective on their origin, function and management. Journal of Environmental Management 60 (1), 7–22.]. These manmade landscapes are typically comprised of fields separated by boundaries, often marked by perennial vegetation (hedges or shelterbelts), yet little is known about the effect of these field margins on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and their dynamics, which offer large carbon sequestration potential [Walter, C., Mérot, P., Layer, B., Dutin, G., 2003. The effect of hedgerows on soil organic carbon storage in hillslopes. Soil Use and Management 19, 201–207.; Falloon, P., Powlson, D., Smith, P., 2004. Managing field margins for biodiversity and carbon sequestration: a Great Britain case study. Soil Use and Management 20, 240–247.]. In hedged landscapes, hedges induce a modification to the soil A-horizon geometry at the slope scale, as attributed to an anti-erosive effect, along with a local modification of the associated SOC stocks. Most studies undertaken within this context have been performed in two dimensions and under favourable conditions for soil accumulation with the hedges lying perpendicular to the steepest slope direction. Consequently, an extrapolation of these findings to the entire landscape can lead to overestimating SOC stocks at the landscape scale. The aims of this paper were to: quantify SOC stocks, describe their spatial variability in three dimensions, and identify the main determinants behind this variability within an agricultural hedgerow network landscape. To achieve these aims, we conducted a detailed field survey that took into account all three dimensions of the soil cover and anthropogenic structures. We then analysed the spatial distribution of SOC contents and stocks with respect to pedological and landscape parameters. Results show that SOC stocks may be locally significant in the vicinity of hedges with a median stock value of 16.6 kg C m−2, in comparison with stock at the landscape scale (13.3 kg C m−2). This study has highlighted the need to incorporate the three dimensions of soil cover at the landscape scale in order to characterise SOC storage. This step will prevent the generalisation of local stocks at a landscape scale given the high variability of SOC stocks (1st quartile=10.5 kg C m−2; 3rd quartile=18.5 kg C m−2) induced by hedge structures.

AB  - Abstract: In this paper the potential of five hybrid poplar clones (Populus spp.) to provide biomass and wood volume in the riparian zone is assessed in four agroecosystems of southern Quebec (Canada). For all variables measured, significant Site effects were detected. Survival, biomass yield and volume yield were highest at the Bromptonville site. After 6 years of growth, total aboveground biomass production (stems+branches+leaves) reached 112.8tDM/ha and total leafless biomass production (stems+branches) reached 101.1tDM/ha at this site, while stem wood volume attained 237.5m3/ha. Yields as low as 14.2tDM/ha for total biomass and 24.8m3/ha for total stem volume were also observed at the Magog site. Highest yields were obtained on the most fertile sites, particularly in terms of NO3 supply rate. Mean stem volume per tree was highly correlated with NO3 supply rate in soils (R 2 =0.58, p <0.001). Clone effects were also detected for most of the variables measured. Total aboveground biomass and total stem volume production were high for clone 3729 (Populus nigra × P. maximowiczii) (73.1tDM/ha and 134.2m3/ha), although not statistically different from clone 915311 (P. maximowiczii × P. balsamifera). However, mean whole-tree biomass (including leaves) was significantly higher for clone 3729 (38.8kgDM/tree). Multifunctional agroforestry systems such as hybrid poplar riparian buffer strips are among the most sustainable ways to produce a high amount of biomass and wood in a short time period, while contributing to alleviate environmental problems such as agricultural non-point source pollution.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to compare coarse root (diameter > 2 mm) and fine root (diameter < 2 mm) biomass, as well as distribution of soil carbon stocks in 3 types of riparian land uses across 4 sites located in farmland of southern Quebec, Canada: (1) hybrid poplar buffers (9th growing season); (2) herbaceous buffers; (3) natural woodlots (varying in tree species and age). For all land uses most of the root biomass was within the 0-20 cm depth range. Total coarse root biomass, to a 60 cm depth, ranged from 8.8-73.7 t/ha in woodlots, 0.61.3 t/ha in herbaceous buffers, and 9.2-27.3 t/ha in poplars. Total fine root biomass ranged from 2.68-8.64 t/ha in woodlots, 2.60-3.29 t/ha in herbaceous buffers, and 1.86-2.62 t/ha in poplars. Total root biomass was similar or higher in poplar buffers compared to a 27 year-old grey birch forest. This indicates that poplar buffers accelerated riparian soil colonisation by roots compared to natural secondary succession. Generally, fine root biomass in the surface soil (0-20 cm) was lower in poplar than in herbaceous buffers; the reverse was observed at greater depth. Highest coarse root biomass in the 40-60 cm depth range was observed in a poplar buffer, highlighting the deep rooted nature of poplars. On average, total soil C stocks (0-60 cm) were greater in woodlots than in riparian buffers. On most sites, soil C stocks tended to be lower in poplar buffers compared to adjacent herbaceous buffers, especially in surface soil, probably because of lower fine root biomass in poplar buffers. Across all sites and land uses, highest soil C stocks at the different soil depths were found in the soil layers of woodlots that also had the greatest fine root biomass. Strong positive linear relationships between fine root biomass and soil C stocks in the 0-20 cm depth range (R-2 = 0.79, p < 0.001), and in the whole soil profile (0-60 cm) (R-2 = 0.65, p < 0.01), highlight the central role of fine root biomass in maintaining or increasing soil C stocks.

AB  - In many temperate agricultural areas, riparian forests have been converted to cultivated land, and only narrow strips of herbaceous vegetation now buffer many farm streams. The afforestation of these riparian zones has the potential to increase carbon (C) storage in agricultural landscapes by creating a new biomass sink for atmospheric CO2. Occurring at the same time, the storage of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in plant biomass, is an important water quality function that may greatly vary with types of riparian vegetation. The objectives of this study were (1) to compare C, N and P storage in aboveground, belowground and detrital biomass for three types of riparian vegetation cover (9-year-old hybrid poplar buffers, herbaceous buffers and natural woodlots) across four agricultural sites and (2) to determine potential vegetation cover effects on soil nutrient supply rate in the riparian zone. Site level comparisons suggest that 9-year-old poplar buffers have stored 9-31 times more biomass C, 4-10 times more biomass N, and 3-7 times more biomass P than adjacent non managed herbaceous buffers, with the largest differences observed on the more fertile sites. The conversion of these herbaceous buffers topoplar buffers could respectively increase C, N and P storage in biomass by 3.2-11.9 t/ha/yr, 32-124 kg/ha/yr and 3.2-15.6 kg/ha/yr, over 9 years. Soil NO3 and P supply rates during the summer were respectively 57% and 66% lower in poplar buffers than in adjacent herbaceous buffers, potentially reflecting differences in nutrient storage and cycling between the two buffer types. Biomass C ranged 49 -160 t/ha in woodlots, 33-110 t/ha in poplar buffers and 3-4 t/ha in herbaceous buffers. Similar biomass C stocks were found in the most productive poplar buffer and three of the four woodlots studied. Given their large and varied biomass C stocks, conservation of older riparian woodlots is equally important for C balance management in farmland. In addition, the establishment of poplar buffers, in replacement of non managed herbaceous buffers, could rapidly increase biomass C, N and P storage along farm streams, which would be beneficial for water quality protection and global change mitigation.

AB  - The diversity of ground-beetle communities (Coleoptera, Carabidae) was studied to assess the short-term impact of new hedges planted in an intensive agro-ecosystem. Hedges represent a new and undisturbed habitat for those polyphagous predators and may provide increased prey availability. Carabids were sampled with pitfall traps in a hedge and an adjacent cultivated field during the whole activity period of these insects to assess the effect of distance from the hedge on species diversity. Fenced pitfall traps were also used to estimate absolute population densities. Several diversity indices were calculated at various sampling levels (total area, distance treatment, trap). Kendall's coefficient of rank correlation between communities at adjacent distances' showed that the greatest changes in species relative abundances occurred close to the hedge. Indices of species richness, dominance concentration, equitability and Fisher's α all indicated a significant decrease in species diversity with increasing distance from the hedge. These trends are explained by two complementary factors. First, the number of species decreased significantly with distance from the centre of the hedge. Second, the various species had different spatial patterns of total capture and absolute density. Four groups of species can thus be distinguished: species restricted to the hedge, species preferring the hedge, species preferring the crop, and species unaffected by the hedge. The respective roles of small-scale abiotic changes in habitat structure and differences in prey availability are discussed.

AB  - 1. A capture-recapture experiment was conducted to examine the effects of satiation state on the activity and foraging efficiency of the carabid beetle Pterostichus melanarius Ill., in four different habitats (a hedge, a transition zone between the hedge and the adjacent wheat crop, the margin of the wheat crop, and the centre of the wheat crop) in an agricultural ecosystem in France. 2. Prey biomass and density decreased from the centre of the hedge to the crop margin and to the centre of the crop, where prey density was low but prey biomass was moderate. Starved and satiated beetles were released in circular enclosures and recaptured using pitfall traps for 6 days. 3. Immediately after release, starved P. melanarius were significantly more active than satiated beetles, but this difference disappeared after the first day. At each recapture date, starved individuals had gained weight whereas satiated individuals had lost weight. The analysis of activity and weight variation at the end of the first day indicated that the centre of the crop seemed to be the most favourable habitat for starved individuals to find food rapidly, whereas the behaviour of satiated individuals was identical in all habitats. 4. This experiment shows that habitat use of P. melanarius is flexible. The results are discussed in the context of the classical view of foraging behaviour in carabid beetles. The activity and foraging efficiency in P. melanarius in different habitats can be explained as the result of the interaction between individual satiation state, prey availability in the habitat, and particular preferences of the species.

AB  - Conservation buffers, areas of non-crop vegetation integrated into agricultural landscapes, enhance many agroecosystem services. Among other benefits, these buffers provide habitat for wildlife and beneficial organisms such as pollinators and pest enemies. However, non-crop vegetation in agricultural settings can also be a source for crop pests. One buffer strategy, fallowing strips of land adjacent to crop fields, provides critical habitat for threatened wildlife species, but fallow strips may increase in-field weeds by creating a reservoir of weed seeds that spreads into the adjacent crop. Fallow buffers also offer few resources for beneficial organisms that provide important pest management services. It has been suggested that conservation buffer practitioners move away from fallowing towards plantings of native forbs and grasses. Planted buffers provide more resources for beneficial organisms while maintaining good habitat conditions for wildlife. It is not clear, however, how these planted buffers augment or diminish weed dynamics in the agricultural landscape. Ecological weed management, an integration of many indirect weed management strategies, can be of critical importance to organic growers who are restricted from using conventional weed management tools. The first two studies of this dissertation examined multiple field edge strategies to determine if they have an impact on ecological weed management in organic cropping systems. The first study investigated how the bank of weed seeds in the soil (the 'weed seedbank') changed over time in relation to field buffer management, distance away from the field edge, and crop type. Results showed how planted buffers, especially those with native warm season grasses, can reduce the number of weed seeds that enter the seedbank. The second study examines how ground dwelling, seed eating organisms ('weed seed predators') to the different field buffer management schemes. The results from this study showed that field buffers had little to no influence on weed seed predators or on the seed predation services they provide. However, crop type did heavily influence these organisms as well as seed removal. Fields with crops that provide dense cover, such as hay, experienced more weed seed predation than fields that were more open and had less vegetative cover, such as harvested maize fields. The results from this weed seed predation experiment, however, may reflect conditions that are specific to our system and to the southeastern United States. One important aspect of the Southeast in relation to weed seed predators is the recent introduction of the invasive red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. Although this ant is now present in high numbers inside southeastern U.S. agricultural fields, it is not clear if they are contributing to weed seed predation services. The third study of this dissertation used video monitoring in an agricultural field to collect direct evidence of Solenopsis invicta and their impact on summer annual weeds. The video data suggest that this ant is not contributing to weed seed predation services. It is not clear from the video data, however, what impact these invasive ants have on native weed seed predators.

AB  - Habitat manipulations, intentional provisioning of natural vegetation along crop edges, have been shown to enhance beneficial epigaeic invertebrate activity in many agricultural settings, but little research has been conducted on this practice in the southeast United States. We conducted a field-scale study to determine if habitat manipulations along the field edges of an organic crop rotation increase the activity-density of beneficial ground-dwelling invertebrates. Pitfall traps were used to collect micro and macro ground-dwelling organisms in nine organic crop fields (three each of maize, soybeans, and hay; 2.5-4.0 ha each) surrounded by four experimental habitat manipulations (planted native grass and prairie flowers, planted prairie flowers only, fallow vegetation, or mowed vegetation) during 2009 and 2010 in eastern North Carolina. Beneficial macro and micro invertebrates collected in these pitfall traps consisted primarily of Carabidae, Araneae, Collembola, and mite species. Results show that habitat manipulations had little effect on the activity-density of the dominant epigaeic invertebrates in our study system. Our results suggest that the activity-density of these organisms were instead determined by a combination of in-field characteristics, such as crop type, weed management practices, and within-field resources, along with the diversity of crop type in neighboring fields and the availability of other resources in the area.

AB  - Weed seed predation was studied in nine organic crop fields (three each of maize, soybeans and hay; 2.5-4.0 ha each) surrounded by four experimental field border types (planted native grass and prairie flowers, planted prairie flowers only, fallow vegetation, or mowed vegetation) during the fall of 2009 and 2010 in eastern North Carolina. We used predator exclusion cages to determine the amount of weed seed removal caused by invertebrates and vertebrates. Three common agricultural weed species, redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), broadleaf signalgrass (Urochloa platyphylla), and sicklepod (Senna obtusifolia), were adhered to individual cards and placed inside the exclosure cages once a month for two weeks. Activity-density of invertebrate weed seed predators was measured with pitfall traps. Results show that field border type had no effect on seed removal rates, but that crop type heavily influenced both weed seed predation and invertebrate seed predator activity-density. Weed seed predation was highest in the dense, perennial hay fields and lowest in the more open harvested maize fields. Activity-densities for field crickets (Gryllus sp.) and the ground beetle Harpalus pennsylvanicus were also high in the hay fields and low in the maize fields, while the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) seemed to prefer the open maize fields. These results show that increasing vegetative diversity in field borders is not always an effective method for conserving weed seed predators, but that higher quality habitat inside the crop field can be achieved by increasing ground cover.

AB  - Mark-recapture experiments in replicated experimental plots were used to assess the relative effects of a barley crop and two widths of a field boundary on the field-to-field movement of three carabid species. Movement of Harpalus rufipes, Pterostichus melanarisu and P. niger was slower through a grassy bank than through a barley crop, indicating that the bank had a lower permeability to these species than the crop. Other variables affecting the movement of carabids through the field boundary were species, dietary condition and width of the field boundary. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to the dynamics of carabid dispersal on farmland.

AB  - From April-September 1992 and from April-August 1993, ground beetles were caught in pitfall traps in three weed strips of different ages and in the adjacent fields. The oldest weed strip contained the highest number of ground beetle species in both years. A decrease in number of species with increasing distance from the weed strips was observed in 1992. Fields bordering on two-year-old weed strips showed an increase in species diversity compared with the previous year. Within the crops, rape contained more species than wheat or maize. The extent of differences in species diversity between weed strips and adjacent fields in terms of the methodology used and the importance of weed strips for several species are discussed.

AB  - In 1992 and 1993 a number of species and individuals of hoverflies, butterflies, wild bees, and thread-waisted wasps in sown weed strips, adjacent fields and a field boundary were investigated in the Swiss plateau near Bern. Insects were directly observed and quantified visually, and caught with yellow pan traps. Observations always revealed distinctly higher numbers of species and individuals in weed strips than in adjacent fields, but in yellow pan traps, opposite results or at least less distinct differences, were noted for some insect groups. In 1992, the two-year-old weed strip contained more species of hoverflies, butterflies and wild bees than the one-year-old strips. This was probably due to the more diverse supply of flowers in the two-year-old weed strip which contained both annual and perennial plants. Weed strips provided suitable nutritional conditions for flower visiting insects and were therefore very attractive habitats for all insect groups investigated in this study.

AB  - Previous observations have shown that slugs found favourable conditions for reproduction in wildflower strips and that they caused high damage to oilseed rape adjacent to the strips. In the current study slug numbers and damage were estimated in wildflower strips and at different distances from the strips into winter wheat crops, from 1994 to 1996. Slug damage was estimated using an index of defoliation and slug numbers and activity were measured using wheat bran traps. Investigations began when winter wheat seedlings emerged and lasted for five weeks. Slug damage was never severe in any of the fields studied. In most fields, slug damage was higher close to the wildflower strips than at greater distances from the strips. The declining slug damage with increasing distances from the wildflowers strips was related to the distribution pattern of juvenile Arion lusitanicus, suggesting that this species was responsible for the higher damage near the strips. Other slug species (Deroceras reticulatum, Arion fasciatus, Deroceras laeve) were more or less evenly distributed over the field or were almost entirely confined to the wild-flower strips. Results showed that winter wheat was not at risk from slug feeding in spite of the establishment of wildflower strips and that therefore the application of molluscicide along the strips is unnecessary.

AB  - In 1995, slug damage and numbers of slugs were estimated in two grass strips and adjacent rape fields. Investigations began as soon as rape seedlings emerged and lasted for five weeks. Slug damage to rape plants 1 m from the grass strips was significantly higher than at greater distances from the strips. Deroceras reticulatum was the most abundant slug species recorded in both grass strips and adjacent rape fields. Arion lusitanicus and Arion fasciatus were much less abundant than D. reticulatum. In one field, D. reticulatum declined steadily with increasing distance from the grass strips and therefore appeared to have caused the majority of severe damage to rape plants close to the strips. This finding was surprising because until now severe slug damage in oilseed rape beside semi-natural habitats has been observed only where A. lusitanicus was abundant.

AB  - In 1992 and 1993, studies examined numbers of adult hoverflies in sown weed strips, adjacent fields and a field boundary in the Swiss plateau, near Bern. Hoverflies were observed quantitatively and were divided according to their larval food. In both years, distinctly more aphidophagous and aquatic hoverflies were observed in the weed strips than in the adjacent fields. Copro- and phytophagous hoverflies were observed in very low numbers acid they were almost entirely confined to the weed strips and the field boundary. The weed strips contained a high density of flowering plants and therefore proved to be very attractive feeding places for all hoverflies. Numbers of aphidophagous hoverflies declined slightly with increasing distance from the weed strips. Possible impacts of weed strips in encouraging aphidophagous hoverflies and their potential as aphid antagonists are discussed.

AB  - - We investigated the response of predatory spiders, carabids, staphylinids and heteropteran bugs to the age of wildflower areas at twenty 1- to 4-year-old wildflower sites and in wheat fields. Density, biomass and species richness of spiders, carabids and bugs increased with the age of wildflower sites, and were higher at older wildflower sites than in the wheat fields. In contrast, staphylinid density decreased significantly with the age of wildflower sites. Canonical correspondence analysis explained 42.4% and 46.7% of the total variance of spider and carabid assemblages, respectively. Spider and carabid assemblages were best explained by vegetation cover. Mean individual weights of spiders, carabids and staphylinids increased significantly with the age of wildflower sites. The positive response of these three groups of beneficials is of practical relevance because many farmers currently remove wildflower areas after two to three years of establishment. Thus, older stages of succession increase the numbers of most beneficials studied.

AB  - Abundance, species richness, diversity and evenness of beetles inhabiting the vegetation layer in twenty 1-4 year old wildflower areas and winter wheat fields were compared to investigate the role of habitat age for biodiversity. Total beetle abundance and also abundance of economically important pest beetles decreased significantly with age of wildflower areas, showing that wildflower areas did not promote large populations with habitat age. Beetle species richness was significantly higher in 2-4 year old wildflower areas than in wheat. Diversity and evenness increased significantly with habitat age. Beetle species composition of wheat differed clearly from that in wildflower areas. Beetle assemblage was significantly associated with plant species richness, vegetation structure and plant biomass, accounting for 11.75, 10.73 and 9.71% of the total variance, respectively. It is therefore recommended to maintain a mosaic of wildflower areas of different age to conserve high beetle diversity in agroecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - - Density and nutritional condition of the five carabid beetle species Agonum mulleri, Anchomenus dorsalis, Anisodactylus binotatus, Pterostichus vernalis and Poecilus cupreus was studied. Carabids were caught in sixteen 1-4-year-old wildflower areas, identified and counted, their nutritional condition was calculated and calculations were related to habitat parameters (i.e. wildflower area age, vegetation cover, soil water content, habitat size, surrounding landscape composition) and sex. Whereas the number of Anisodactylus binotatus caught responded positively to succession in wildflower areas, A. mulleri numbers tended to decrease and the other three species were unaffected. In a stepwise multiple regression species affiliation, sex and age of wildflower area explained together 98.5% of the variance in the pooled nutritional condition of Anchomenus dorsalis, Anisodactylus binotatus, A. mulleri and P. vernalis. Age of wildflower area alone explained 61.7% of the variance and age increased the nutritional condition of carabids. Correspondingly, nutritional condition of Poecilus cupreus was positively correlated with the age of wildflower area. Overall, the nutritional condition of the carabid assemblage studied increased from the first to the second year and then remained stable. To keep the proportion of I year-old wildflower areas low, wildflower areas should therefore be maintained for several years to improve the life conditions of carabid beetles and to enhance their beneficial effects in agroecosystems.

AB  - Species richness and abundance of staphylinid and carabid beetles overwintering in winter wheat fields and 1- to 3-year-old wildflower areas were investigated during 2000/2001 on 16 study sites in Switzerland. Abundance and species richness of overwintering staphylinids significantly increased with successional age of the wildflower areas and were always higher in older wildflower areas than in winter wheat. A similar but less distinct pattern was observed for the abundance and species richness of carabid beetles. The influence of habitat parameters (vegetation cover, fine sand content, organic matter, pH, soil pore volume, surrounding landscape structure, habitat area) on the staphylinid and carabid assemblages based on the number of individuals per species and site was analysed using canonical correspondence analysis. Vegetation cover was the most significant parameter significantly characterizing both staphylinid and carabid assemblages. The amount of vegetation cover explained 15.7% of the variance, fine sand content accounted for 13.3% and surrounding landscape structure for 10.9% of the variance in the staphylinid assemblage. In the carabid assemblage, vegetation cover was the only significant factor, explaining 24.7% of the variance. This study showed for the first time that the significance of wildflower areas as a reservoir for hibernation for generalist predatory beetles increases with progressing successional age.

AB  - Ground beetles are polyphagous predators that often colonize cereal fields from adjacent habitats. Boundaries separating these habitats may filter the movement of species across them resulting in differences in species composition among the habitats. Ground beetles were captured in spring 1995 at 3 sites, autumn through spring 1995-1996 at 4 sites, and autumn through spring 1996-1997 at 2 sites using pitfall traps positioned in riparian strips, wheat fields, and along riparian-wheat field edges. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to arrange ground beetles along temporal and spatial gradients. Autumn and spring assemblages of ground beetles were separated along the Ist canonical axis. The 2nd canonical axis further separated spring and winter assemblages of ground beetles. With the effects of season removed, ground beetles were classified with respect to habitat association along axes 1 and 2 of a partial canonical correspondence analysis. Based on this analysis, ground beetles occupying wheat field interiors and wheat field edges were separated from those occupying riparian interiors and riparian edges along the Ist canonical axis. The 2nd canonical axis separated beetles occupying interior habitats from those occupying edge habitats. We classified beetles as habitat generalists, wheat specialists, riparian specialists, or boundary specialists. Riparian areas may serve as permanent habitats for ground beetles to colonize cereal fields. Because of their continuous seasonal activity and predatory nature many species of ground beetles are good candidates for biological control of wheat pests.

AB  - Natural habitats adjacent to or near agricultural fields harbor a variety of beneficial arthropods that assist in pest control. Ground beetles are polyphagous predators of various agricultural pests and often colonize cereal fields from adjacent habitats. Our objective was to measure the richness, diversity, and evenness of ground beetles in the interiors and boundaries of winter wheat fields and adjacent grasslands and riparian zones, and suggest strategies for managing carabid diversity and abundance in agricultural landscapes. We used pitfall traps to study ground beetles in winter wheat fields and in adjacent riparian zones and grasslands from 1993 through 1997 in north-central Oklahoma. During autumn, winter, and spring, species richness, evenness, and diversity were generally higher in the natural habitat interiors and the edges than in the interiors of wheat fields. We suggest adding grassy strips to wheat fields and extending the saum (zone of perennial herbs and grasses) adjacent to wooded riparian habitats to supplement numbers and diversity of ground beetles in the agricultural landscape.

AB  - Apparent competition, mediated by a shared predator, plays a key role in conservation biological control. Appropriate agroecosystems management may favour this type of indirect interaction. In that context, our aim was to test the effect of rose bush [ Rosa rugosa (Thunb.)] strips on the building up of aphid populations and of their natural enemies in adjacent cereal habitats. Several aphid species are currently found on Rosa sp. including Metopolophium dirhodum (Walker) for which it is a primary host. Aphid predators and parasitoids may build their populations on the aphid population present on Rosa sp. and later on migrate to wheat field during the cereal aphid infestation. Moreover, the flowers of the rose bushes may provide a source of nectar and pollen to these natural enemies. Our experiment was conducted in three rose margin wheat plots with a strip of rose bushes of R. rugosa and three control plots. Plots were compared during 2 years (2003 and 2004). Aphid, parasitoid and predator densities were recorded from May to the harvest of wheat on rose bushes and in wheat. In 2003, the aphid densities were moderate but in 2004, the population of aphid was very high. Even if predator and parasitoids arrived earlier in rose margin field than in control ones, the presence of rose bushes did not influence the aphid population within the field. Metopolophium dirhodum did not seem to migrate from the rose bushes to wheat. The level of parasitism was weak in rose bushes and the natural enemy population was not different in rose margin wheat and in control plots. The causes of the lack of efficiency of this type of management are discussed as well as the high aphid population in wheat in 2004.

AB  - Increased intensification in agricultural grasslands has led to well-documented declines in the associated flora. Manipulation of field margins for biodiversity enhancement in arable systems has been extensively investigated. However, there is a paucity of corresponding long-term research within intensively managed grasslands. We investigated a combination of establishment and management methods to enhance botanical diversity of newly established field margins in intensively managed grasslands. Three methods of field margin establishment were investigated including fencing, natural regeneration by rotavation, or seeding with a wildflower mixture. Subsequent sward management by either grazing or mowing was tested at three margin widths. Success of establishment was addressed in terms of persistence of species richness, plant community composition and incidence of noxious weeds. Seeding with a wildflower mixture was the most successful establishment method to enhance plant species richness and this effect persisted throughout the 7 years of the experiment ( = 16·4 ± 0·43 SE plant species richness per 1 × 3 m quadrat). Mown ( = 6·01 ± 0·30 SE) and rotavated ( = 9·7 ± 0·34 SE) treatments contained significantly fewer plant species; grazed controls contained 9·83 ± 0·24 species. Grazing led to a significant, but modest increase in species richness in fenced and rotavated plots compared to the mowing treatment, but had no effect in seeded plots. Grazing also led to an increased frequency and cover of competitive grasses in the seeded treatment. Although margin width was not found to significantly influence species richness, there was increased herb cover and reduced abundance of noxious weeds in the wider seeded margins. Synthesis and applications. The choice of establishment method and subsequent management of grassland field margins significantly affected their conservation value. The botanical diversity of margins within intensively managed pasture can be enhanced by sowing wildflower seed mixtures. This diversity can be maintained over time through appropriate management, i.e. either the reduction of high grazing pressure by seasonal fencing, or annual mowing. Management approaches that involve minimal change are currently adopted in many agri-environment schemes (such as fencing and/or the cessation of nutrient inputs) but did not produce swards of conservation value in this study.

AB  - Flying pattern of Dipteran adults and distribution of larvae in soil and litter were studied using yellow water traps and soil samples, respectively, in four positions near the border of a barley field: in the hedgerow, the grass strip, the field margin (either with perennials or with barley) and the centre of the field. The sampling and trapping covering all seasonal aspects were performed in an agricultural landscape near Venice (Italy). Higher numbers of flying adults were trapped in the field margin and the field; values in the hedgerow and the grass strip were lower. In contrast, the lowest values of larval abundance were found in the field, while values in the extended field margin, the grass strip and the hedgerow were higher. Comparison of extensively used (uncultivated) part of the field margin with intensively used part of the field margin and centre of the field indicated that the increase in larval abundance in the uncultivated margin is caused by reduced cultivation and not by marginal position. According to the spatial distributions of adults and larvae, several groups can be distinguished. The first Dipteran group develops in various habitats and prefers the field as adults, e.g. for hunting (Dolichopodidae). The second group develops in the field (particularly, some pest Chloropidae and Agromyzidae) and occurs there as adults too. Grass strip and hedgerow affect the flight activity of these groups negatively. The third Dipteran group prefers the hedgerow, the grass strip and the field margin as adults. Some of these develop in an extensive strip (Scatopsidae) near the hedgerow and some outside the studied plot (Culicidae). Finally, there are Diptera which develop in the extensive part of the field margin (Chironomidae) and disperse around all investigated habitats. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Agricultural intensification and expansion are regarded as major causes of worldwide declines in biodiversity during the last century. Agri-environment schemes (AES) have been introduced in many countries as an attempt to counteract the negative effects of intensive agriculture by providing financial incentives for farmers to adopt environmentally-sensitive agricultural practices. We surveyed 18 pairs of AES and conventionally-managed farms in central Scotland (United Kingdom) to evaluate the effects of specific AES management prescriptions (field margins, hedgerows, species-rich grasslands and water margins) on farmland moths. We also measured the influence of the surrounding landscape on moth populations at three spatial scales (250 m, 500 m and 1 km radii from each trapping site) to assess at which scale management was most important for the conservation of farmland moths. In general, percentage cover of rough grassland and scrub within 250 m of the trapping site was the most important landscape predictor for both micro- and macromoth abundance and macromoth species richness, although negative effects of urbanization were found at wider scales (within 1 km), particularly for macromoth species richness. The abundance and species richness of micromoths was significantly higher within field margins and species-rich grasslands under AES management in comparison to their conventional counterparts, whereas AES water margins increased micromoth abundance, but not species richness. AES species-rich grasslands and water margins were associated with an increased macromoth abundance and species richness, and macromoths considered 'widespread but rapidly declining' also gained some benefits from these two AES prescriptions. In contrast, hedgerows under AES management enhanced neither micromoth nor macromoth populations. Synthesis and applications. Our findings indicate that increasing the percentage cover of semi-natural environment at a local scale (e.g. within 250 m) benefits both micro- and macromoth populations, and that the implementation of simple AES management prescriptions applied to relatively small areas can increase the species richness and abundance of moth populations in agricultural environments.

AB  - Spiders and beetles provide important ecosystem services in agriculture; however, optimum strategies to promote their density and diversity on dairy farms have received little attention. This study aimed to quantify the effects of farming practice (conventional vs. organic), fencing (fenced vs. unfenced) and plant species origin (exotic vs. native) on the abundance and diversity of spiders and beetles within shelterbelts on eight conventional and six organic dairy farms in North Island, New Zealand. Invertebrates were collected from a total of 43 shelterbelts by vacuum suction and beating in January 2008 and 2009. Organic farms and fenced shelterbelts supported 40% and 67% higher densities of spiders than conventional farms and unfenced shelterbelts, respectively. Shelterbelts of native plant species supported higher species richness of native spiders and beetles than shelterbelts of exotic plants. A combination of converting to organic farming, fencing off shelterbelts and planting more native shelterbelts is likely to provide increased ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation on New Zealand dairy farms.

AB  - Within agricultural landscapes many species of birds depend on hedgerows and woodland, but few studies have examined their relative importance as habitats for breeding birds. Breeding bird communities in hedgerows and woodland in lowland England and Wales were compared in terms of species richness and similarity of species composition. The preference of individual species for hedgerows and woodland was also assessed. The data were drawn from 33 farmland and 35 woodland Common Birds Census plots for 3 years: 1990, 1993 and 1996. Woodland plots were significantly richer in species than farmland plots. Species number on farmland plots increased linearly with the cover of farm woodland and non-linearly with density of total hedgerow. Species number increased with density of non-roadside hedgerows, but not with density of roadside hedgerows. Although the farmland and woodland plots supported distinctive bird communities, there was considerable overlap between them in species composition. The similarity between the species composition on individual farms and that theoretically possible for woodland increased significantly with the cover of farm woodland, hedgerow density and the total amount of woody habitat present within the farmland plot. Canonical correspondence analysis and preference indices indicated that seven species could be regarded as hedgerow specialists: Dunnock Prunella modularis, Whitethroat Sylvia communis, Lesser Whitethroat S. curruca, Linnet Carduelis cannabina, Goldfinch C. carduelis, Greenfinch C. chloris and Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella. Species showing clear preferences for woodland were: Tawny Owl Strix aluco, Marsh Tit Parus palustris, Coal Tit P. ater, Goldcrest Regulus regulus, Spotted Flycatcher Muscicapa striata, Treecreeper Certhia familiaris, Nuthatch Sirra europaea, Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos major, Chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita and Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla. The habitat needs of the hedgerow specialists show considerable variation and do not always coincide with the hedgerow structures that support the greatest numbers of bird species and highest densities of birds. Management strategies that maintain a diversity of hedgerow structures are, therefore, desirable. Hedgerow and woodland bird communities are essentially complementary and habitat creation initiatives in lowland agricultural landscapes should not be excessively weighted towards one habitat or the other. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to asses which components of landscape structure in lowland English farmland could best predict patterns in bird community composition, total bird density and densities of 12 bird species. As far as possible, predictors were sought that were consistent in their effects over a 20 yr period. The data were derived from mapping censuses in 1966, 1970, 1974, 1978, 1982 and 1986 with yearly sample sizes ranging from 41 to 51 plots, of minimum size of 50 ha. Landscape composition was quantified in terms of 10 landscape variables representing broad structural (e.g. density of woodland) and crop attributes (e.g. proportion of area under cereals) plus attitude. Gradients in bird community composition were defined as plot scores on axis 1 of a detrended correspondence composition were defined as plot scores on axis 1 of a detrended correspondence analysis (AXIS1). This gradient consistently represented a gradient from plots rich in woodland bird species to ones rich in field-feeding and wetland species. Multiple regression was used to build models containing, 2-, 3- and 4-variables. Two approaches were used to combine data from the six years and models based on the single best subset in each year were found to be most consistent with respect to predictor selection. Predictors were tested by building models based on each combination of five years and assessing how well the predictors explained variation in the bird variables for the sixth, how well the predictors explained variation in the bird variables for the sixth, independent year. The predictors were relatively successful in explaining variations in densities of wren, robin, willow warbler, blue tit, great tit and chaffinch but especially AXIS1 which was explained in terms of woodland density, field size and altitude. The predictors were unsuccessful in explaining total bird density, song thrush density and whitethroat density. Structural attributes of landscape (especially density of hedgerow and woodland, but also rivers and ponds) were frequent predictors of species densities, but variables relating to farming system were not, with the exception of skylark and yellowhammer which were positively associated with extent of cereal crops. Implications for landscape design and management, and the relative contribution of woodland and hedgerows to bird communities in farmland landscapes are discussed. There was considerable variation between individual years which suggests that models of bird-habitat relationships based on single years may have limited general application.

AB  - Forested riparian buffers are intended to reduce the sediment and nutrient loads to streams delivered by agricultural runoff. Within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed, buffers are mandated to be 100’ wide along agricultural f ields bordered by perennial streams. When flow into buffers is widely disseminated buffers have the potential to significantly reduce pollutant levels entering streams. However, several studies show that flow across buffers is often concentrated, producing channelized flow that bypasses the buffer and presumably reduces buffer effectiveness. Previous studies have relied on field observations in relatively few locations, however, and the extent of bypassing is not well constrained. We hypothesize that buffer bypassing and the associated reduction in buffer effectiveness is a widespread phenomenon. Here we use GIS to determine flow patterns on agricultural fields and to identify locations of concentrated flow through buffers in the Virginia Coastal Plain withi n the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. Using DEMs with ≤10m resolution, we determine flow accumulation along field margins and identify points with flow accumulation sufficient to generate concentrated flow into buffers. Flow accumulation data from 27 fields has shown that 51 % to 91% of the total area draining to the field margins pass through 10 discrete points , representing <1 % of the field margin length. Using i n - field observations we have located channels and surface flow evidence within riparian buffers and u sing GIS we have generated a slope/area relationship at these locations. Our results show a relationship of decreasing slope with increasing area necessary for channel initiation at the buffer. GIS flow accumulation and slope data should be used as precision tool s in the placement of riparian buffers to maximize buffer effectiveness and reduce buffer - bypassing.

AB  - This paper reports on a unique resurvey of the composition of a species rich ancient hedgerow in Cambridgeshire, UK, 27 years after the original study. The hedge contained sections that were unmanaged and unaffected by agrochemicals, as well as sections which were cut annually, adjacent to an intensively managed arable field. Between the two surveys there was a general decline in species richness in all sections of the hedge, particularly in ground flora normally associated with ancient woodland. A mean of 0.42 woody species per 30-m length of hedgerow was lost in 27 years. Contrary to a priori expectation, there was no suggestion that damage was greater in the farmed section. These results highlight that zero management is not an appropriate option for maintaining the floral diversity of species rich and ancient hedgerows. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The distribution of the carabid beetle Nebria brevicollis was monitored in the summer during a period of declining activity associated with aestivation in a hedgerow. After emergence from aestivation, population density, distribution and dispersal of N, brevicollis were studied during autumn 1994 in a mark-recapture experiment, 3560 beetles were marked and 1887 were recaptured in a grid of pitfall traps spanning a hedgerow and extending approximately 32 m either side into two recently harvested cereal fields, Population size, estimated from a Lincoln index, increased slightly with time with a mean population density of approximately 0.9 beetles m-2. Activity-density varied during the experiment and was significantly related to maximum temperature. The population was aggregated within the hedgerow during aestivation and in several spatially stable hot-spots of activity-density within the field during autumn. There was considerable movement within fields but the hedgerow was a significant barrier to dispersal between fields, with potential effects on the metapopulation structure of the species.

AB  - Management of Oriental fruit moth, Grapholitha molesta (Busck), in apple using an 'Enhanced Integrated Pest Management IPM)' program comprised of a hedgerow barrier, pheromone-based mating disruption and reduced-risk [nonorganophosphorous (OP) or carbamate] insecticides was investigated over a 5-year period. The barrier was comprised of a planting of three rows of hybrid poplar, Populus deltoides Bartr. × Populus nigra L., one row of Italian alder, Alnus cordata L. (nectar reward), and one row of white pine, Pinus strobus L. The hedgerow completely surrounded the perimeter of the apple orchard and was treated with garlic and a low rate of pyrethroid insecticide in 4 of the 5 years. The Enhanced IPM program significantly reduced G. molesta populations as measured by moth captures in pheromone traps. Captures of G. molesta were significantly higher in apple orchards treated with OP and carbamate insecticides, 'Conventional IPM', and either not surrounded by the hedgerow or with the barrier present but not treated with the repellent compounds. To explain these differences in G. molesta control, and the potential non-lethal effect of hedgerow barriers on G. molesta orchard colonization, we studied the adult vertical movement in a traditional unsprayed standard apple orchard at three different heights: 0.95, 1.95 and 3.20 m, respectively. In the overwintering generation at a height of 0.95 and 1.95 m, the mean number of moths captured per sampling period was 14.64 and 14.84, respectively, and only 2.95 at 3.20 m. However, the number of individuals captured in the second and third generations was not significantly different at the three different heights. Fruit damage evaluated before 'June drop' closely corresponded to the distribution of moths captured during the overwintering generation. Fruit damage at a height of 1.95 and 3.20m was 5.8 and 3.5%, respectively. These results indicated that G. molesta is a weak flyer and that hedgerow barriers exerted some influence in the colonization of the orchard by limiting the free movement of adults from the overwintering generation. Thus, hedgerow barriers seem to limit early migration and establishment of G. molesta in the orchard. This in turn may reduce the size of the following generations and makes subsequent control easier under the Enhanced IPM program. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - A study was made of Orthoptera assemblages of crossfield and headland (field-edge) public footpaths in the Chelmsford area of Essex, UK, in 2006. Orthoptera populations were monitored using a standardised transect counting procedure in both footpath types to determine whether headland footpaths Provided benefits to Orthoptera on intensively managed farmland. Species richness of Orthoptera was significantly higher on headland footpaths (6 species) than on crossfield rights of way (3 species), suggesting that footpaths along the edges of fields may provide refuges in arable farmland. It seems that the absence of regular ploughing on the headland footpaths may be beneficial to mesophilous grasshopper species, the crossfield footpaths constituting too much of an ephemeral habitat (due to annual Ploughing and cropping) to support the full range of species. Abundance of all Orthoptera and of individual species was not significantly higher on headland footpaths, although replicates on the sheltered and sunny eastern side of hedgerows had relatively high densities.

AB  - Orthoptera were monitored on field edge public footpaths on the east (leeward) and west (windward) side of hedgerows in Chelmsford, UK, in 2006. A total of 6 species were recorded from footpaths on the leeward side of hedgerows probably due to the shelter from the prevailing westerly winds provided by the trees and shrubs. On the windward side of hedgerows species richness and abundance of Orthoptera were reduced (only 4 species were recorded). It is suggested that shelter from the wind and the exposure to early morning sunlight for Orthoptera on the east side of hedgerows are important factors governing their occurrence on farmland. Many replicates had Environmental Stewardship (ES) scheme field margins adjacent but they did not affect Orthoptera species richness or abundance. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.

AB  - Non-crop habitats provide important resources for natural enemies. Many natural enemies hibernate in non-crop habitats, from which they may colonise arable fields in the spring. Spring colonisation ensures annual repopulation of the crop with natural enemies, allowing them to keep pace with the development of pest populations. The availability of non-crop habitats can, therefore, be crucial to successful conservation biological control. We quantified the density of overwintering natural enemies near organic Brussels sprout crops in five different non-crop habitats (short grassy field margin, herbaceous field margin, herbaceous field margin under a tree line, ditch and forest). Soil and litter samples of non-crop habitats were taken at two sites. One site was located in an open agricultural landscape, the other in a landscape dominated by mixed forest. Insects belonging to Staphylinidae, Araneae, Carabidae, Coccinellidae and Dermaptera were the most abundant. Mean densities of predatory arthropods were higher in the open agricultural landscape (290 predators m(-2)) than in the forested landscape (137 predators m(-2)). Herbaceous habitat types supported the highest densities of overwintering predators (up to 400 predators m(-2)), whereas densities in the forest were lowest (10 predators m(-2)). These results indicate that herbaceous non-crop habitats are important refugia for predators and may play a vital role in conservation biological control.

AB  - Linear habitats are becoming increasingly common as a consequence of habitat fragmentation, and may provide the sole habitat for some species. Hedgerows are linear features that can vary substantially in structure and quality. Having surveyed 180 hedgerows, in four locations, and sampled their small mammal communities we examined the effect of physical hedgerow attributes on the abundance of small mammal species. Using three elements of landscape structure, we explored whether variation was best explained by the Random Sample Hypothesis (that small islands represent a random sample of those species populating larger areas), or by the Fragmentation Hypothesis (that species abundance will decrease with a loss of habitat area). We tested the relationship between the relative abundance of small mammals and 1. hedgerow connectivity; 2. total habitat availability and 3. local habitat complexity. We then explored the predictive power of combinations of these habitat variables. Connectivity was a positive predictor of wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus, and hedgerow gappiness was a negative predictor of bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus. The total amount of habitat available (hedgerow width, height and length) was a positive indicator of total small mammal biomass. These results support the Fragmentation Hypothesis that species abundance and distribution decrease with a loss of habitat area. The preservation of linear and associated habitats may therefore be important in maintaining metapopulations of the species we studied. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - Burning of pastures is a management practice adopted by graziers worldwide. When rain falls on burnt pastures, it can lead to increased pollutant transport in runoff. However, this transport can be modified by vegetative buffers which intercept the runoff downslope of burnt areas. This study examines the effects of different pasture buffer lengths (0, 2, and 5 m) on sediment and chemical transport from two pasture sites near Wivenhoe Dam, the main water reservoir for Brisbane City. Simulated rainfall (100 mm/h) was applied to 18 plots on pasture sites after they were burnt, and insoluble and soluble components were measured in the runoff. Most eroded sediment/organic debris accumulated against the first row of the grass buffer strips or was deposited in the upslope backwater region. Buffer length had little impact on the runoff concentrations of NO(3)(-) and NO(2)(-) (NO(x)), total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and total nitrogen from the 5-m-length upslope plots but was significant for sediment loss rate, filterable reactive phosphate, ammonium, and total and dissolved organic carbon. Pasture type was significant for NO(x), ammonium, sediment loss rate, and total organic carbon only. Burning increased enrichment ratios of nutrients and carbon in the runoff compared with unburnt plots, but a 2-m buffer strip subsequently reduced the enrichment ratio values by > 30%. Buffers strips of unburnt pasture grass may provide an effective tool for post-fire erosion control following prescribed burning; however, further work including scaling to larger plot sizes and catchment level is required.

AB  - Many forms of natural heritage manifested as streams, rivers, ponds, lakes and wetlands play an integral role in maintaining natural beauty, health and a high quality of life. Agricultural intensification in southern Ontario has contributed to elevated sediments, nutrient and bacteria levels in water bodies. Vegetative filter strips (VFS) are control measures that can partially remove sediments and pollutants adhered to sediments from overland runoff before entering water bodies. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of vegetation type, width of the filter strip, runoff flow rate and inflow sediment characteristics on effectiveness of the VFS in removing pollutants from runoff. The results show that sediment removal efficiency increased from 50 to 98% as the width of the filter increased from 2.5 to 20 m. In addition to the width of the filter strip, grass type and flow rate were also significant factors. This study indicates that the first five (5) metres of a filter strip are critical and effective in removal of suspended sediments. More than 95% of the aggregates larger than 40 mu m in diameter were trapped within the first five metres of the filter strip.

AB  - Hedgerow is one of the most important rural landscapes in the world, especially in Europe. Knowledge about the hydrological role of hedgerows is useful in many fields of study, such as hydrological modelling and rural landscape management. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a hedgerow on rainfall distribution, soil-water potential gradient, lateral water transfer and water balance. A hillslope with a hedgerow perpendicular to the slope was monitored. To evaluate hedgerow rainfall interception, rainfall was measured (hourly, daily, and by rainfall event) both next to and up to 16 m upslope and 12 m downslope perpendicularly away from the hedgerow. The strongest correlation between rainfall next to the hedgerow and rainfall at more distant points was obtained using data measured per rainfall event. The average percentage of rainfall intercepted equalled 28% for the leafed period and 12% for the leafless period. The impact of the hedgerow on spatial rainfall distribution was related to distance from the hedgerow and rainfall amount. Annual distribution of soil-water potential showed that the hedgerow influenced it up to 9 m upslope and 6 m downslope, the area in which most of the hedgerow's roots were observed. The soil was driest at the end of summer, which delayed soil rewetting during autumn in areas surrounding the hedgerow. Annual groundwater dynamics exhibited three distinct periods due to temporal rainfall distribution and, especially at the end of summer, root-water uptake. In addition, the total potential gradient showed that unsaturated flow was directed towards the hedgerow in summer and autumn. These results indicate that at the local scale hedgerows influences (1) spatial rainfall distribution, (2) soil rewetting, and (3) groundwater recharge, often at distances well beyond the hedgerow's drip line. Consequently, the processes involved in soil-water dynamics around hedgerows should be integrated into relevant hydrological models, especially for catchments with a dense hedgerow network.

AB  - Linear vegetation structures such as hedge tree networks (hedgerows), shelterbelts, and isolated trees play a major role on soil water transfer. Our objective is to evaluate the influence of a bottomland hedgerow on water flux in the saturated and unsaturated zones. Soil water movement was investigated in a hillslope crossed by a hedgerow using total water-potential gradients and shallow groundwater dynamics. Results of a dry year were presented by Ghazavi et al. (2008). In this study, we analyse a wet year and then compare the two contrasting years (dry and wet). During the 2 years, the soil located at the vicinity of the hedgerow developed a drier status than the surrounding soils. Water flux in the unsaturated zone was directed towards the hedgerow for a longer period during the dry year than the wet year. The duration of delayed rewetting of the soil decreased from 3 months for the dry year to 1 month for the wet year. Variation in water storage calculated over the study period was highest near the hedgerow and lowest far from the hedgerow. In the hillslope studied, hedgerow and stream proximity controlled water transfer. It is clear that the hedgerow controlled water transfer in the unsaturated zone throughout the year, except for the period when the soil profile was fully saturated. First, hedgerows control water transfer by increasing lateral transfer, which is related to high soil water potential gradients in its vicinity. These processes may increase capillary rise and decrease groundwater recharge near the hedgerow. Second, reverse hydraulic gradient (upward flux of water) occurred during the period of lowest groundwater level, mainly because of groundwater and stream connectivity. Processes related to hedgerow presence, such as delayed soil rewetting and flow towards the hedgerow need to be considered to quantify the impact of linear vegetation structures on water flux. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The annual value of crop pollination and biological control of plant pests provided by beneficial insects is estimated to be worth at least $22 billion to United States crop production. Beneficial insects that supply these services to agricultural lands are threatened by limited or suboptimal resources due to the loss of biodiversity in agroecosystems, which is a growing concern in agricultural states like Iowa. Conservation practices are recommended to address a multitude of conservation concerns related to Iowa's declining natural resources; however, guidelines for best practices that conserve beneficial insects are not well defined. Due to the valuable relationship of beneficial insects and successful crop production, there is a need for developing best practices that conserve beneficial insects within Iowa's agricultural landscape. The first objective was to design mixtures of native perennial plants that range in diversity and resource availability and evaluate these different plant communities as candidates for buffer strips that attract and conserve beneficial insects. The second objective was to evaluate the insect community in non-crop buffer strips already established on organic farms and in the adjacent organic crops and conventional row crops. This research seeks to identify mixtures of native perennial plants optimized with resources attractive to pollinators and natural enemies and to determine if these mixtures can enhance Iowa's buffer strips to conserve beneficial insects and protect their services. Best-practices for conserving beneficial insects can be adapted for different regions, land uses, and habitat restoration scenarios beyond the study system used for this research.

Conservation practices are recommended to address a multitude of conservation concerns related to Iowa's declining natural resources; however, guidelines for best practices that conserve beneficial insects are not well defined. Due to the valuable relationship of beneficial insects and successful crop production, there is a need for developing best practices that conserve beneficial insects within Iowa's agricultural landscape. The first objective was to design mixtures of native perennial plants that range in diversity and resource availability and evaluate these different plant communities as candidates for buffer strips that attract and conserve beneficial insects. The second objective was to evaluate the insect community in non-crop buffer strips already established on organic farms and in the adjacent organic crops and conventional row crops. This research seeks to identify mixtures of native perennial plants optimized with resources attractive to pollinators and natural enemies and to determine if these mixtures can enhance Iowa's buffer strips to conserve beneficial insects and protect their services. Best-practices for conserving beneficial insects can be adapted for different regions, land uses, and habitat restoration scenarios beyond the study system used for this research.

AB  - Growing concern for non-point source pollution in agricultural watersheds has generated alternative agronomic practices such as filter strips that minimize off-site movement of farm chemicals and sediment. Guidelines for establishment of filter strips in the Midwest region of the US are few with respect to the interplanting of fine hardwood tree species that can provide additional income to farm owners as well as site protection. This study was undertaken to discern the effects of different herbaceous cover types on tree growth and survival when interplanted. Ladino clover (Trifolium repens L.) and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) were sown and seedlings of three tree species, green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh.), black walnut (Juglans nigra L.), and red oak (Quercus nigra L.) were planted within each cover type to examine the performance of these integrated cover-tree systems. A series of plots containing the native mix of annual and perennial weed species was used as a control. Height and stem caliper of the trees were taken for 4 years. Additionally, habitat quality for bird species was assessed with respect to the corn (Zea mays L.) crop the filter strips replaced. Results indicated that cover type had little influence on tree growth and survival when weed control adjacent to seedlings was effective. Compared with the native weed population, clover and grass covers allowed equal height growth of trees, providing no greater competition but higher management costs. For habitat quality, filter strips provided better habitat for birds when compared with corn. Thus, the construction of filter strips with tree species along streams or drainage ditches can take several forms that can serve to filter excess nutrients and sediment.

AB  - The effectiveness of a narrow grass hedge in reducing runoff nutrient loads following swine slurry application was examined. Slurry was applied to 0.75 m wide by 4.0 m long plots established on an Aksarben silty clay loam soil located in southeast Nebraska. Manure treatments consisted of no manure application and manure application to meet the 1, 2, or 3 year nitrogen (N) requirements for corn. Runoff water quality was measured during three 30 min simulated rainfall events. The grass hedge did not significantly reduce runoff nutrient transport after the swine slurry, which contained relatively small amounts of manure, was applied. Increasing the N application rate from a 1 year to a 3 year corn N requirement also did not result in a significant increase in N or phosphorus (P) loads in runoff. The grass hedge significantly reduced electrical conductivity (EC) measurements from 0.78 to 0.73 dS m-1and pH values from 8.16 to 7.85. The rates of transport of dissolved P, particulate P, and total P were each influenced by runoff rate and increased in a linear fashion from 7 to 25, 65 to 357, and 72 to 382 g ha-1min-1, respectively. Runoff rate significantly affected rates of transport of NO3-N, NH 4-N, and total nitrogen, which increased in a linear fashion from 273 to 1204, 30 to 47, and 323 to 1490 g ha-1min-1, respectively. Runoff rate is an important variable that should be considered when estimating nutrient transport following application of swine slurry containing relatively small amounts of nutrients. © 2013 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers ISSN 2151-0032.

AB  - The effectiveness of a narrow grass hedge in reducing runoff nutrient loads following manure application was examined in this study. Beef cattle manure was applied to 0.75 m wide by 4.0 m long plots established on an Aksarben silty clay loam located in southeast Nebraska. Manure was added at rates required to meet none or the 1, 2, or 4 year nitrogen requirements for corn. Runoff water quality was measured during three 30 min simulated rainfall events. Manure application rate significantly affected dissolved phosphorus (DP) and total phosphorus (TP) loads in runoff on the plots without a grass hedge. However, DP and TP loads were not significantly affected by manure application rate on the plots containing a hedge. The hedge reduced the mean load of DP in runoff from 0.69 to 0.08 kg ha -1 and the load of TP from 1.05 to 0.13 kg ha -1. When averaged across manure application rates, 0.11 kg NO 3-N ha -1, 0.02 kg NH 4-N ha -1, and 0.49 kg total nitrogen (TN) ha -1 were measured from the plots with a hedge, compared to 0.39 kg NO 3-N ha -1, 0.55 kg NH 4-N ha -1, and 2.52 kg TN ha -1 from the plots without a hedge. For the plots with a grass hedge, runoff loads of DP and TP where manure was applied were similar to values obtained with no manure application. Each of the runoff water quality parameters was significantly affected by runoff rate. A narrow grass hedge placed on the contour across a hillslope significantly reduced runoff nutrient loads following variable manure applications. © 2011 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - This rainfall simulation study provided information on the effects of 0.72 m (2.4 ft) wide switchgrass hedges located at the bottom of plots on runoff and soil loss under both no-till and tilled conditions. The study area, which had slopes ranging from 8 to 16%, had produced corn for 33 years and the grass hedges had been established for six years. Simulated rainfall [64 mm hr -1 (2.5 in hr -1)] was applied for two hours to plots [3.7 m (12 ft) wide by 10.7 m (35.1 ft) long] with corn residue and to plots where corn residue was removed. The narrow grass hedges substantially reduced runoff and soil loss. Under no-till conditions, the plots with corn residue and grass hedges averaged 52% less runoff and 53% less soil loss than similar plots without grass hedges. Under tilled conditions, the plots with corn residue and grass hedges averaged 22% less runoff and 57% less soil loss than comparable plots without grass hedges. The plots with corn residue removed but with grass hedges present averaged 41% less runoff and 63% less soil loss than similar plots without grass hedges. Narrow grass hedges are an effective conservation measure, especially when used in conjunction with such conservation practices as no-till or reduced-till farming systems.

AB  - The placement of stiff-stemmed grass hedges on the contour along a hillslope has been shown to decrease nutrient transport in runoff. This study was conducted to measure the effectiveness of a narrow grass hedge in reducing runoff nutrient transport from plots with a range of soil nutrient values. Composted beef cattle manure was applied at dry weights of 0, 68, 105, 142, and 178 Mg ha -1 to a silty clay loam soil and then incorporated by disking. Soil samples were collected 243 days later for analysis of water-soluble phosphorus (WSP), Bray and Kurtz No. 1 phosphorus (Bray-1 P), NO 3-N, and NH 4-N. Three 30 min simulated rainfall events, separated by 24 h intervals, were then applied. The transport of dissolved phosphorus (DP), total P (TP), NO 3-N, NH 4-N, total nitrogen (TN), runoff, and soil erosion were measured from 0.75 m wide x 4.0 m long plots. Compost application rate significantly affected soil measurements of WSP, Bray-1 P, and NO 3-N content. The transport of DP, TP, NO 3-N, NH 4-N, TN, runoff, and soil erosion was reduced significantly on the plots with a grass hedge. Mean runoff rates on the hedge and no-hedge treatments were 17 and 29 mm, and erosion rates were 0.12 and 1.46 Mg ha -1, respectively. Compost application rate significantly affected the transport of DP, TP, and NO 3-N in runoff. The experimental results indicate that stiff-stemmed grass hedges, planted at selected downslope intervals, can significantly reduce the transport of nutrients in runoff from areas with a range of soil nutrient values.

AB  - Farmland bird population trends were examined on a sample of lowland English farms to assess the relative importance of habitat loss and habitat degradation. Data were extracted from 11 farms surveyed by territory mapping between 1966 and 1986 as part of the British Trust for Ornithology's Common Birds Census. The population size of 38 bird species was quantified for each farm in each year. The extents of five non-crop habitats were measured at 4-yearly intervals on each farm. The farms were selected because some had undergone extensive removal of non-crop habitats while others had undergone little or none. Although declines were commonest on farms where the severest habitat loss had taken place, we found no evidence that habitat loss was the main factor causing population declines: all 11 farms had significant numbers of declining species, even where habitat loss was minimal. Furthermore, general linear modelling found no significant effects of habitat loss on population trends and principal-components analysis found limited effects of habitat extent on community composition. These results suggest that habitat loss is of secondary importance in causing farmland bird population declines. We suggest that other processes, such as habitat degradation, may have caused a baseline population decline in at least 10 farmland bird species and that declines may have been exacerbated by localised habitat loss.

AB  - In a previous study on habitat use by Rhinolophus euryale in an Atlantic area (Northern Iberian Peninsula), this bat species foraged exclusively in woodland, including both native deciduous woodland and exotic plantations. As the study was carried out in a landscape that was profoundly altered by industrial forestry, we predicted that in a better preserved landscape this species would select smaller feeding areas located at closer distances from the roost, according to the optimal foraging theory, and would use almost exclusively the preferred habitat, i.e., native deciduous woodland. To test these hypotheses, we radiotracked 14 R. euryale from the largest known breeding colony of northern Iberian Peninsula and determined their habitat selection, spatial foraging pattern, and hunting behaviour. Our predictions on habitat selection, as well as on the foraging site size and on commuting range were confirmed. Rhinolophus euryale used almost exclusively native deciduous woodland, and hedgerows were positively selected. We suggest that the richness of tree species in hedgerows provides a high prey availability sustained in time and space. Our findings show that habitat disturbance constitutes a major cause of decline for R. euryale in the study area.

AB  - Buffer strips represent oblong land elements along water bodies playing an important role for the water quality management of the surface water. In the policy context buffer strips are referred to as land with defined farming restrictions aiming at protecting the water course. In the current EU agricultural policy framework the majority of the decisions regarding subsidy schemes for buffer strips is taken on the member country level, which results in great differences between the EU members with regard to this water protection measure. If incentives for farmers for establishing and maintaining buffer strips are in place, they are usually linked to the harvest ban on the buffer strip. Such protection model can be endangered by volatile and rising prices for agricultural products. However, buffer strip can represent a valuable source of different ecosystem services, including biomass provision. If harvesting under certain restrictions would be allowed, the biomass could generate additional revenue that might contribute to securing buffer strips existence and consequently maintaining their protection function.This study aimed at assessing the costs and environmental consequences of biomass mobilizing from buffer strips. It dealt with different scenarios of biomass sourcing from extensively cultivated buffer strips in the Netherlands. In 12 scenarios, the cultivation of grass or cereal mixes (including multiple harvesting or perennial cultivation) for different valorisation chains (ensiling or fodder & bedding) was assessed. Both total net cultivation costs as well as the hectare based environmental performance (using the Life Cycle Assessment methodology) were evaluated. Additionally, the environmental impact of electricity production through anaerobic digestion of biomass from buffer strips was compared with the impact from digestion of classic grass silage and the impact profile of Dutch electricity mix.The results indicate ensiling as the scenario generating more net costs and higher environmental impacts as compared to fodder & bedding. In the latter, the cereal cultivation represents a better solution from economic perspective, while grass shows lower environmental impacts. Moreover, optimizing grass cultivation through switching to perennial mode contributes to strong improvements of the economic performance and contributes to additional reduction of environmental impacts, and consequently delivers the best environmental and economic solution. Moreover, the comparison with the Dutch electricity mix shows that biomass from buffer strips, if used in anaerobic digestion, can, in terms of environmental performance, compete with classic silages and contribute to reduced environmental damage. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A sample of 1,500 farmers and 2,000 non-farmers were surveyed during 2005-2006 to examine the impact of field windbreaks on visual appearance of agricultural lands in Iowa, USA. About 73% of respondents indicated that field windbreaks diversified visual appearance of agricultural landscapes, Whereas 67% of these respondents thought that windbreaks made agricultural lands visually more appealing. An improved aesthetics of the area was fourth most frequently mentioned reason for planting field windbreaks reported by 21% of respondents. When compared to other windbreak benefits, however, improved aesthetics of agricultural landscapes was ranked as the least important windbreak benefit. Majority of respondents (50%) preferred groups of trees planted in straight rows followed by groups of trees nested between agricultural fields (23%), groups of trees planted in non-straight rows (20%), and single trees dispersed between fields (7%). Respondents preferred windbreaks that were tall, wide, long, and continuous. Most of them (74%) preferred field windbreaks consisting of trees and shrubs, whereas 69% preferred windbreaks in which conifers were mixed with hardwoods. Respondents who preferred groups of trees planted in non-straight rows were 5.0 times more likely to indicate that windbreaks improved visual appearance of agricultural lands than those who preferred single trees. Those who preferred groups of trees nested between agricultural fields or groups of trees planted in straight rows were 3.6 and 2.6 times more likely, respectively, to indicate that windbreaks improved visual appearance of agricultural lands in comparison to those who preferred single trees.

AB  - CHAPTER 2: ESTIMATES OF ADDITIONAL MAIZE (ZEA MAYS) YIELDS REQUIRED TO OFFSET COSTS OF TREE-WINDBREAKS IN MIDWESTERN USA Selected field windbreak (shelterbelt) designs were evaluated to assess their cost effectiveness of providing additional crop production, carbon sequestration, and hunting opportunities. In terms of additional crop production, a three-row mixed windbreak with extensive management and low cost is the most cost effective because it requires the smallest corn yield increases to break even. Using a sheltering effect of 12 windbreak heights, the required additional yield is 0.28 Mg ha -1 yr-1 . A four-row spruce windbreak with intensive management and high costs is the least cost effective because it requires the largest corn yield increases that are 28 times larger than those of the mixed windbreak. Trees that grow faster and taller are more cost effective because they provide sheltering effect sooner and over larger distances allowing to break even with smaller yield increases that are more likely to be achieved. In terms of carbon sequestration, a four-row cottonwood windbreak is the most cost effective because it accumulates the greatest amounts of above and below-ground carbon that allow it to break even with a lifespan as short as 30 years. Only a cottonwood windbreak accumulates enough carbon to break even at a comparison price of $10.48 Mg -1 . A higher carbon price of $32.38 Mg-1 enables a mixed windbreak to break even. Spruce windbreaks (two and four rows) require higher prices to break even. Continuous CRP payments offset a significant portion of windbreak costs and allow more windbreaks to break even and at earlier times. About 55% of agricultural producers in Northeastern Iowa indicated that there is potential for fee hunting in field shelterbelts and on adjacent lands. However, they think that the potential is either weak or moderate. Almost all producers (95%) currently allow hunting. They believe that hunting is more important in providing intangible benefits such as recreation/enjoyment and better stewardship than tangible ones such as additional income and economic opportunities for the local community. On average, the producers require $22.74 per visit to allow a party of four hunters to access their land to hunt pheasants. The compensation amount is influenced more by producers' attitudes toward hunting than by socioeconomic factors.

AB  - 1. Riparian management has been embraced by water and land managers globally to offset the deleterious effects of intensive agricultural land use on aquatic ecosystems. However, the documented responses of stream communities to riparian management have been variable, particularly in highly degraded systems. 2. We used boosted regression trees and structural equation models to assess the effects of riparian condition and stream size on the invertebrate communities of 64 agricultural waterways on the Canterbury Plains, New Zealand. We hypothesized that small streams would be more degraded than larger waterways but would show a greater increase in the abundance of pollution-sensitive aquatic invertebrates in response to riparian management. We also predicted that land-use legacies of poor in-streamhabitat would reduce the effectiveness of current riparian management. The two strongest determinants of community structure were primarily in-stream habitat, where sedimentation and low water velocity had negative impacts on stream communities, and stream size, with smaller waterways generally more impacted than large waterways. Not surprisingly, with > 150 years of agriculture and patchy riparian management on the plains, current management has not greatly improved in-stream habitat and thus had little effect on the abundance of sensitive aquatic insect (EPT) taxa. 3. Managed streams did, however, have more pollution-sensitive communities in general. This was largely mediated by decreased stream temperature, narrower/deeper channels and greater organic matter resources in streams with riparian planting and restricted stock access. Thus, if water velocity and sedimentation issues can be mitigated, then riparian management should become more effective. 4. Synthesis and applications. Within the context of a degraded agricultural landscape, we identified factors limiting the effectiveness of riparian management for stream invertebrate communities. Riparian management should primarily target and protect small streams and those without degraded in-stream habitat. Intensive management, such as in-stream habitat or channel morphology modification, may be needed to address historical factors (e.g. low velocity and sedimentation), which otherwise may continue to limit community recovery.

AB  - Grass seed cropping systems in the Pacific Northwest account for about half of the cool-season forage and turf grass seed production in the world. Grass seed cropping systems are intensely managed with inorganic fertilizers to sustain production. Much of the land where grass seed production occurs in western Oregon is marginally productive for most other crops because of the poorly drained soil conditions. The role of riparian areas bordering grass seed fields in moderating surface water and groundwater quality is not well understood. A study sire in western Oregon was instrumented to determine how riparian areas bordering grass seed fields process N and thereby influence water quality. The site consisted of a perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) seed field, a riparian area, and an intermittent creek. Groundwater levels were monitored during the fall of 1995 to the late spring of 1996 and a complete set of samples were collected every two weeks from wells with water and analyzed for NO3(-) and NH4(+). Total fertilizer applied to the crop was 200 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), Data indicated a lateral subsurface hydrologic flow path from the cultivated field through the riparian zone, to the creek. Averaged over the season (November 1995 - June 1996), riparian zone A and C horizon groundwater mean NO3(-) concentration was mostly undetectable and less than 3.8 mg L-1 in the agricultural field. At all sampling concentration was higher in the field than in the riparian zone. Seasonal mean groundwater NH4(+) concentrations for the riparian and field A and C horizons were less than or equal to 0.2 mg L-1, Annual crop net N accumulation was 144 kg N ha(-1). Riparian soil electrode potentials (Eh) at 25 and 45 cm averaged -200 to -100 mV during the wet cycle, whereas the field ranged between 0 to +50 mV. Collectively, findings indicate that both crop and riparian processes at the Lake Creek site are responsible for reducing shallow groundwater NO3(-) to low levels.

AB  - In many agricultural areas, hedgerows give rise to strong expectations of reducing the inputs of excess nitrate to the groundwater and rivers. This study aims to analyse the spatial and seasonal influences of a hedgerow on nitrate dynamics in the soil and groundwater. Nitrate (NO 3 -) and chloride (Cl -) concentrations were measured with spatially dense sampling in the unsaturated soil and in the groundwater along a transect intersecting a bottomland oak (Quercus rubor) hedgerow after the growing season and during the dormant season. We explain NO 3 - dynamics by using Cl - as an index of tree-root extension and water transfer. At the end of the growing season, NO 3 - is entirely absorbed by the trees over a large and deep volume corresponding to the rooting zone, where, in contrast Cl - is highly concentrated due to root exclusion. However, these observed patterns in the soil have no influence on the deep groundwater composition at this season. During the dormant season, water transfer processes feeding the shallow groundwater layer are different upslope and downslope from the hedgerow in relation to the thickness of the unsaturated zone. Upslope, the shallow groundwater is fed by rainwater infiltration through the soil which favours Cl - dilution. Right under the hedge and downslope, the rapid ascent of the groundwater near the ground surface prevents rainwater input and Cl - dilution. Under the hedgerow the highest concentrations of Cl - coincide with the absence of NO 3 - in the shallow groundwater layer and with high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon. The absence of NO 3 - during the dormant season seems to be due to denitrification in the hedgerow rooting zone when it is rapidly saturated by groundwater. © 2011 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Chloride is a major anion in soil water and its concentration rises essentially as a function of evapotranspiration. Compared to herbaceous vegetation, high transpiration rates are measured for isolated trees, shelterbelts or hedgerows. This article deals with the influence of a tree hedge on the soil and groundwater Cl- concentrations and the possibility of using Cl- as an indicator of transpiration and water movements near the tree rows. Cl- concentrations were measured over 1 year at different depths in the unsaturated zone and in the groundwater along a transect intersecting a bottomland oak hedge. We observed a strong spatial heterogeneity of Cl- concentrations, with very high values up to 2 g l-1 in the unsaturated zone and 1.2 g l-1 in the upper part of the groundwater. This contrasts with the low and homogeneous concentrations (60-70 mg l-1) in the deeper part of the groundwater. Cl- accumulation in the unsaturated zone at the end of the vegetation season allows us to identify the active root zone extension of trees. In winter, upslope of the tree row, downwards leaching partly renews the soil solution in the root zone, while the slow water movement under the trees or farther downslope results in Cl- accumulation and leads to a salinization of the soil and groundwater. This salinization is of the same order as experimental conditions produce negative effects on oak seedlings. The measurement of Cl- concentrations in the unsaturated zone under tree rows at the end of the vegetation season would indicate whether certain topographic, pedological or climatic conditions are likely to favour a strong salinization of the soil, as observed in the present study.

AB  - Vegetated fi lter strips (VFS) have become an important component of water quality improvement by reducing sediment and nutrients transport to surface water. Th is management practice is also benefi cial for controlling manure- borne pathogen transport to surface water. Th e objective of this work was to assess the VFS effi ciency and evaluate the uncertainty in predicting the microbial pollutant removal from overland fl ow in VFS. We used the kinematic wave overland fl ow model as implemented in KINEROS2 coupled with the convective-dispersive overland transport model which accounts for the reversible attachment-detachment and surface straining of infi ltrating bacteria. Th e model was successfully calibrated with experimental data obtained from a series of simulated rainfall experiments at vegetated and bare sandy loam and clay loam plots, where fecal coliforms were released from manure slurry applied on the top of the plots. Th e calibrated model was then used to assess the sensitivity of the VFS effi ciency to the model parameters, rainfall duration, and intensity for a case study with a 6-m VFS placed at the edge of 200-m long fi eld. Th e Monte Carlo simulations were also performed to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the VFS effi ciency given the uncertainty in the model parameters and key inputs. Th e VFS effi ciency was found to be <95% in 25%, <75% in 23%, and <25% in 20% of cases. Relatively long high-intensity rainfalls, low hydraulic conductivities, low net capillary drives of soil, and high soil moisture contents before rainfalls caused the partial failure of VFS to retain coliforms from the infi ltration excess runoff .

AB  - The Kentucky Division of Water indicates that agriculture is responsible for 55% of the Commonwealth's assessed streams not supporting their designated uses. Riparian buffers reduce nonpoint source pollution in agroecosystems by storing and cycling nutrients, stabilizing streambanks, increasing infiltration, and storing water. Specific information regarding riparian buffer management is needed for land managers to maximize buffer effectiveness at reducing agricultural contaminants impairing water quality. Baseline soil properties (texture, pH, C and nutrients) of the riparian buffer surrounding a tributary of Cane Run Creek in Fayette County, KY were characterized prior to imposing three mowing regimes (intense, moderate, and no mow treatments) and one native grass regime. Measurements were made along parallel transects located 2-m and 8-m distances from the stream. Root biomass, aggregate distribution, and saturated hydraulic conductivity were measured along the 2-m transect in two consecutive years following treatment establishment. The 2-m transect soils had the highest C, pH, Ca, Zn, and sand content. The 8-m transect had the highest P, K, Mg, and clay content. Semivariogram analysis of C content indicated slight to moderate spatial dependency along the 2m transect and moderate to strong spatial dependency along the 8m transect. Root biomass increased with decreased mowing frequency at the surface depth after one year; the native grass treatment had significantly less root biomass in both years compared to mowing treatments. There was no significant treatment effect on aggregate size distribution at the surface depth in either year. Mean weight diameter and large macroaggregates decreased from 2011 to 2012. Vegetation treatment had no statistically significant effect on water stable aggregates or saturated hydraulic conductivity. Experimental semivariograms provided evidence of spatial structure at multiple scales in root biomass, aggregates, and soil C. Spatial variability occurred over a shorter lag distance in 2012 than 2011, suggesting an effect of imposed treatments slowly developing over time.

AB  - Greenways have recently been established in some intensively farmed areas of South Sweden in order to enhance recreation opportunities and biodiversity, but the effects of these green structures on biodiversity have not yet been determined. In this study, greenways and experimental sown wildflower strips were investigated for butterfly and bumblebee diversity. In total, 1,769 butterflies of 18 species and 1,216 foraging bumblebees of eight species were recorded. Sown wildflower strips proved to support much higher abundances and species numbers of butterflies and bumblebees than greenways, with 86% of all butterflies and 83% of all bumblebees being observed in the sown flower strips. However, in both types of green structure mostly common species were found. Counts of flower visits showed that Knautia, Centaurea and Cirsium were the most commonly visited plant species. The greenways studied did not seem to fulfil their function of enhancing biodiversity-at least not for butterflies and bumblebees. However, these greenways could easily be improved for common bumblebee and butterfly species by sowing wildflower strips along their margins.

AB  - The export of dissolved phosphorus (P) in surface runoff from agricultural land can lead to water quality degradation. Surface application of aluminium (Al)-based water treatment residuals (Al-WTRs) to vegetated buffer strip (VBS) soils can enhance P removal from surface runoff during single runoff events. However, the longer-term effects on P removal in VBSs following application of products such as Al-WTR remain uncertain. We used field experimental plots to examine the long-term effects of applying a freshly generated Al-WTR to VBSs on dissolved P export during multiple runoff events, occurring between 1 day and 42 weeks after the application of Al-WTR. Vegetated buffer strip plots amended with Al-WTR significantly reduced soluble reactive P and total dissolved P concentrations in surface runoff compared to both unamended VBS plots and control plots. However, the effectiveness of Al-WTR decreased over time, by approximately 70 % after 42 weeks compared to a day following Al-WTR application. Reduced performance did not appear to be due to drying of Al-WTR in the field. Instead, the development of preferential flow paths as well as burying of Al-WTR with freshly deposited sediments may explain these observations. Better understanding of the processes controlling long-term P removal by Al-WTR is required for effective management of VBSs.

AB  - Human-dominated landscapes are characterized by a mosaic of natural and managed ecosystems, affecting arthropod communities on different spatial scales. Effective landscape management for functionally important organisms suffers from little understanding of organism spillover between semi-natural habitats and adjacent crops, and of how it is affected by the surrounding landscape., We examined syrphid abundance (Diptera: Syrphidae) in three types of linear semi-natural habitats, differing in connectedness to annual crops and forest [forest edges ( n = 12), forest-connected hedges ( n = 11) and isolated hedges ( n = 12)], as well as in the adjacent oilseed rape or winter wheat fields (i.e. altogether n = 70 sites in 35 landscapes). The landscape circles with 1 km radius around the study sites differed in the proportion of oilseed rape (ranging from 0% to 35% oilseed rape) enabling us to test landscape-scale effects of oilseed rape., Aphidophagous syrphids were more abundant in forest-connected hedgerows than in forest edges (with isolated hedges being intermediate), and more abundant in crop fields adjacent to hedgerows than adjacent to forest edges, indicating spillover from semi-natural habitats to the adjacent crop fields. Aphidophagous syrphid abundance was higher in semi-natural habitats adjacent to oilseed rape fields than adjacent to wheat fields if the proportion of oilseed rape in the landscape was low (indicating local concentration)., Synthesis and applications. This study highlights the potential of hedgerows to enhance the abundances of beneficial syrphids and their spillover to adjacent crop fields, especially when they are connected with forests. We provide evidence that this local exchange is moderated by the extent of mass-flowering crops in the surrounding landscapes due to local concentration. Therefore, measurements for the improvement in local biological functioning should be evaluated by simultaneously investigating local and regional aspects of crop configurations to allow for region-specific management recommendations. Increasing the total amount of hedgerows in the agricultural matrix under moderate landscape-scale proportions of mass-flowering crops may serve best for the conservation of biodiversity and augmentation of important ecosystem services such as biological control and pollination in landscapes dominated by agricultural cultivations.

AB  - 1. The structural complexity of agricultural landscapes influences the local biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Hence, developing effective biodiversity management requires a better understanding of the relative importance of local and landscape changes, especially for functionally important organisms such as hoverflies benefiting from flowering plants. 2. We examined hoverfly (Diptera: Syrphidae) communities in broad and narrow sown flower strips, in naturally developed grassy strips and in wheat fields (as a control). We also investigated the effects of these four habitat types on syrphid occurrence in the adjacent wheat fields. 3. The relative influence of local vs. landscape effects was tested by selecting study sites along a gradient of structural complexity from simple landscapes (∼100% arable land) to complex landscapes (up to 70% semi-natural habitats such as fallows, field margins, hedges and grassland). Landscape complexity was assessed within landscape sectors of 0·5–4·0 km radius around strips. 4. Syrphid density and in particular, the density of aphidophagous species, was higher in narrow and broad sown flower strips compared to grassy strips and wheat–wheat boundary controls at the milk-ripening stage of the wheat. In addition, species richness of aphidophagous syrphids within wheat fields adjacent to broad sown flower strips was higher at the wheat peak-ripening stage. This indicates a spillover between habitats and a positive effect of these sown flower strips on potential biocontrol of cereal aphids. Flower densities and syrphid diversity and density, respectively, were closely related. 5. Species richness and abundance in the sown flower strips increased as the proportion of arable land in the surrounding landscape increased, suggesting that within structurally simple landscapes (at 0·5–1 km radius around the sites) syrphid flies concentrated on the most rewarding resources within the sown flower strips. Sown flower strips were more effective at increasing syrphid species richness and abundance in simple landscapes, presumably because the creation of flower resources made the greatest difference in such homogeneous, intensively managed arable landscapes. 6. Synthesis and applications. Agri-environment schemes should take the surrounding landscape characteristics into account when considering using sown flower strips to enhance syrphid density and diversity, and their biocontrol function, in arable landscapes. Creating locally such flower strips is more effective in simple landscapes containing a high proportion of arable land, while in complex landscapes, keeping the overall diversity is important.

AB  - Native grass conservation buffers established for grassland birds require periodic disturbance, but disturbance of vegetation and soil may increase abundance and activity of imported fire ants (Solenopsis sp.). This is a concern because fire ants are invasive, often respond positively to disturbance and can be a major cause of nest losses in grassland birds. We experimentally tested if fire ant mound density and foraging activity increased after burning and disking in native grass buffers. In 2008, fall disking increased mound density and foraging activity during the first growing season post-disturbance, but burning did not. In 2009, disking had no effect, but effects of disking the previous season persisted into the second growing season. Prescribed fire, which tends to maintain or increase perennial grass cover, may be a better option than disking for managing native grass buffers where fire ant densities are high.

AB  - Aims: In agroforestry systems, root activity of trees may either reduce nutrient leaching beneath neighboring crops or compete with them. A previous study reveals high chloride (Cl) accumulation in the soil under a bottomland oak hedgerow in western France. Our study tests whether Cl can be used as an indicator of the spatial extent of tree root activity. Methods: Cl was analyzed in soil profiles up to 2 m deep along transects perpendicular to hedgerows. One site was explored in detail to examine the role of hedgerow position on the slope, supplemented with multi-annual and multi-site studies on bottomland hedgerows. Results: Upslope Cl accumulation was highest near the tree line (and up to 6 m away) and around 1 m deep. Downslope it extended up to 18 m from the tree line and near the surface. This difference was caused by differences in water availability or physical soil constraints. Cl accumulation was found in both temporal (multi-annual) and spatial (multi-site) studies. Conclusions: Cl accumulation under oak hedgerows can be used to identify the lateral extent and depth of water uptake by roots. It results from root activity over many years. The method is more suitable for poorly drained soils.

AB  - Riparian buffer zones are defined as strips of natural vegetation separating streams or lakes from surrounding upland landscapes. These zones may effectively reduce the nitrate-N load in shallow ground water draining intensively fertilized agricultural regions. Contemporary research has tended to focus on wide, forested riparian zones situated on poorly drained lowland sites. In addition, research has typically focused on the growing season, when the ecosystem is biologically active, with relatively dry hydrological conditions. This field study monitored spatial and temporal patterns of nitrate-N in a comparatively narrow, non-forested buffer zone situated in an upland agricultural watershed in southern Ontario. Results show that the nitrate attenuation ability of the buffer zone is spatially and temporally variable. At one site, the buffer zone consistently reduced concentrations of nitrate from input values greater than 10 mg/l, to less than 1 mg/l. At another site, located only 200 m up stream, the reduction of nitrate concentrations was much less. However, the rate of nitrate attenuation in terms of mass was similar at both sites. Temporal variations were observed in the nitrate attenuation ability of both sites. While the ratio of nitrate removed to nitrate input decreased during the dormant season, the actual mass removed increased. Differences in hydrogeological structure and land use associated with the two sites are likely responsible for the different attenuation patterns.

AB  - Two of the management prescriptions for the Breckland Environmentally Sensitive Area in East Anglia, Great Britain, concern the outer 6 m of cropped fields: 'Uncropped Wildlife Strips' (no crop sown and restricted pesticide applications) and 'Conservation Headlands' (restricted pesticide applications). The impact of these two management regimes on communities of spiders, carabid beetles and Heteroptera in cereal field headlands was evaluated in 1988. The total abundance of each group was highest in uncropped strips, but also higher in Conservation Headlands than in fully sprayed headlands. Species diversity for spiders and Heteroptera was significantly higher in uncropped strips and Conservation Headlands than in fully sprayed headlands. Species richness for both these groups and carabids was higher in all fields in uncropped headlands and Conservation Headlands than in the fully sprayed controls. The community structure of carabids and spiders was altered by headland management; it also changed with the age of the uncropped strips. Movement of Heteroptera from field boundaries into the crop was affected by headland treatment. The implications of these results are discussed with reference to gamebird survival, biological control of cereal pests and wildlife conservation issues.

AB  - To find out if winter wheat is infested with pests insects from sown weed strips and if beneficial arthropods enhanced by weed strips could decimate pests efficiently near them, strip-managed winter wheat fields and one field without a strip were investigated. Ar different distances from the weed strips and from the field edge, respectively, pest insects and their antagonists were registered by visual control and by sweep netting in 1993 and 1994. The dominant pest insects were cereal aphids and leaf beetles. The infestation with aphids was always very low and did not show any differences between the studied distances from the weed strip. In 1993, the cereal leaf beetles were more numerous in the field without strip than in the strip-managed ones and at the beginning of their incidence in 1994, they were significantly more numerous in the middle of the Field than close to the weed strip. Consequently, cereal crop was not more infested with pest insects near a weed strip than in the rest of the field. Predatory arthropods such as spiders, Nabidae and Dolichopodidae were found in larger numbers near the weed strips than in the middle of the Grids. However, parasitic Hymenoptera were mostly equally distributed over the whole fields. The number of aphidophagous predators was not significantly different between the studied distances in the wheat fields, but they were often more abundant in the strip-managed fields than in the field without a strip. There were fewer aphids per larvae of syrphids near the sown weed strips than in the middle of the fields and this predator-prey relationship was also closer and, consequently, better in the strip-managed fields than in the field without a strip. Thus, an enhancing effect of beneficial arthropods by sown weed strips on the adjacent wheat fields and a reduction of pest insects could be shown.

AB  - With crop rotation as a fundamental element of the LPM and organic production, crop plants and their pests change beside permanent sown weed strips. Rape pests which are known to populate the fields from the edges might be augmented by sown weed strips. To evaluate whether weed strips have a negative impact on rape crop, insect pests and their antagonists were studied in a winter rape held near Berne, Switzerland, divided into two parts by a sown weed strip. They were registered at different distances from the weed strip and from the opposite field boundary in 1993. The pollen beetle Meligethes sp. and the cabbage weevils Ceutorhynchus assimilis Payk., C. napi Gyll. and C. pallidactylus Marsh. and the brassica pod midge Dasineura brassicae Winn. were significantly more frequent near the held boundary than in the middle of the field and close to the sown weed strip. This could be because a sown weed strip does not act as a real field edge. For the investigated rape pods, little difference was observed as to the rate of infestation of C. assimilis. It was astonishing that only a few predators were caught by sweep netting in the whole held as well as close to the weed strip. A higher number of parasitoids near the sown weed strip could not be found either, which was probably due to their high mobility. The low rate of parasitization of the rape pests was only once assessed clearly higher near the weed strip than in the rest of the field. Therefore, flower visiting predators and parasitoids might not have been efficiently increased the weed strip. Generally, no negative impact of the weed strip on rape crop was found and therefore sown weed strips could be suitable areas in a farming with crop rotation to diversity an agroecosystem.

AB  - The abundance and activity of carabid beetles in the headlands of cereal fields in the Breckland ESA, England, were monitored using pitfall traps and directional barrier traps. Uncropped wildlife strips were 6 m wide headlands left unsown and unsprayed but rotovated in autumn. Early the following spring they had significantly less vegetation than fully-sprayed headlands planted with winter wheat. Pterostichus melanarius was more common in the open field than in either headland treatment. Agonum dorsale was least abundant in the uncropped wildlife strip but this habitat was significantly preferred by Bembidion lampros throughout the spring and early summer. A. dorsale had clear directional movement out from the field boundary into the crop in early May. The presence of the wildlife strip did not create a significant barrier to this movement, nor did it significantly reduce the rate at which B. lampros dispersed out into the crop. On the contrary it was such a favourable habitat for this species that it acted as an additional source of colonising individuals. The results are discussed in the context of the effects of headland management on the colonisation of crops by polyphagous predators and their potential for the biological control of aphid pests.

AB  - Nitate retention in riparian buffer strips is well documented in summer periods, but the potential of winter retention within these zones is poorly documented. Two sites, grass (Lolium perenne L.), and poplar (Populus italica)-vegetated riparian strips, were investigated in southern England (River Leach). Groundwater flow was via subsurface pathways within the sites, NO3- concentration gradients and loading rates were calculated over the winter period. Nitrate retention was found to be linearly dependent on load rate. Nitrate retention occurred at the edge of the riparian zone. This was most obvious in the poplar site where all hillslope-derived NO3 was absorbed within the first 5 m of flow within the riparian strip. When loading rates into the sites increased, NO3 absorption migrated upslope from the riparian site. The poplar-vegetated riparian zone was found to be more resilient (99% retention of NO3-) than the grass-vegetated riparian zone (84% retention of NO3-) in the winter months. It is postulated that although vegetation has no active role in retaining NO3- in the winter, above-ground vegetative biomass does contribute C to the soil microbacterial biomass that is engaged in NO3- reduction in the winter months, this accounted for the greater efficiency of the poplar vegetated site.

AB  - Recent studies of agricultural watersheds have indicated that vegetated filter zones (VFZ) may not function optimally because of channelized surface runoff through the zone. One promising solution has been to disperse channelized surface runoff in the receiving portion of the filter zone (FZ) with level spreaders. However, widespread adoption of level spreaders as a best management practice requires designs that are both functional and cost effective over a range of site characteristics including FZ condition and with varying sources of nonpoint-source pollution and under differing rates of loading. The main objective of this research was to evaluate different level spreader designs and configurations for dispersing channelized agricultural runoff and to evaluate them for enhancing FZ effectiveness on several sites with greatly differing watershed characteristics. Other objectives included estimating construction and maintenance costs and developing recommendations for level spreaders for specific watershed and FZ conditions. Level spreaders with associated instrumentation were constructed on eight watersheds from 1989 to 1997 representing a wide variety of watershed and FZ conditions. Spreaders without associated instrumentation were constructed on three watersheds. Source areas included crops under both conventional and conservation tillage, a pasture, a dry-lot for dairy cattle, and a paved and partly-roofed cattle containment area. Designs tested included commercial galvanized gutters, treated wood, fabric-lined ditches with gravel just above and below the ditch, and vegetated berm and trench. Reductions in NPSP through-puts were a function of filter zone size, input concentration, runoff volume, and season. Filter zones where FZ area was greater than two percent of source-area size generally removed a least a third of each analyte. Of the six sites with dispersed flow which did not have large unaccounted contributions to the FZ, only one failed to reduce N by 30 percent. All spreader designs improved FZ performance. Level spreaders with larger cross-sectional areas were more effective for high peak-flow events. The most easily maintained design is a vegetated berm and trench spreader shaped from soil. This design also allows limited vehicle traffic over the spreader.

AB  - We examined whether nitrogen(N) and phosphorus(P) export was enhanced from grassland receiving inorganic fertilizer and manures typical of intensive livestock production. Buffer strips were included in the study to determine if they could reduce nutrient export. Hillslope plots receiving granular inorganic fertilizer, liquid cattle slurry and solid cattle manure (FYM) were compared using rainfall simulation for 4 storms on consecutive days at 22 mm h(-1) and 35 minutes duration. The plots were hydrologically isolated in a randomized block layout of 4 treatments x 3 replicates and measured 30 x 5 m; the upper 20 m received either fertilizer, slurry or FYM, while the lower 10 m acted as an unfertilized grass buffer strip. Nitrogen and P export in surface runoff from grassland receiving inorganic fertilizer exceeded that from FYM or slurry treatments; concentrations up to 46 mg N l(-1) and 15 mg P l(-1) were recorded. Sixty eight % and 62% of the N from FYM and slurry respectively was exported in organic form. Seventy four % (FYM) and 39% (slurry) of the P was in particulate or dissolved organic form. The buffer strip reduced N export in surface runoff by 94% and P export by 98% from inorganic fertilizer plots. A 75% reduction in N export was recorded from the buffer zone below slurry plots but only a 10% reduction in P, with most P remaining in the particulate or dissolved organic fraction. There was no significant difference in N export from the buffer zone between the inorganic fertilizer treatment and the untreated control.

AB  - Unfertilized buff er strips (BS) generally improve surface water quality. High buff er strip effectiveness (BSE) has been reported for sloping shallow aquifers, but experimental data for plain landscapes with deeply permeable soils is lacking. We tested a novel method to determine BSE on a 20-m-deep, permeable sandy soil. Discharge from soil to ditch was temporarily collected in an in-stream reservoir to measure its quantity and quality, both for a BS and a reference (REF) treatment. Treatments were replicated once for the first, and three times for the next three leaching seasons. No significant BSE was obtained for nitrogen and phosphorus species in the reservoirs. Additionally, water samples were taken from the upper groundwater below the treatments. The effect of BS for nitrate was much bigger in upper groundwater than in the reservoirs that also collected groundwater from greater depths that were not influenced by the treatments. We conclude that measuring changes in upper groundwater to assess BSE is only valid under specific hydrogeological conditions. We propose an alternative experimental set-up for future research, including extra measurements before installing the BS and REF treatments to deal with spatial and temporal variability. The use of such data as covariates will increase the power of statistical tests by decreasing between-reservoir variability.

AB  - Nitrates have been shown to have detrimental effects on both the aquatic environment and on human health, and with the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive beckoning, assessments as to the most appropriate agricultural techniques to minimize the leaching of solutes into surrounding water courses need to be made. Riparian buffer strips are considered an effective means of attenuating concentrated nitrates in agricultural runoff. Whilst a large number of scientific investigations have focused on nitrate removal mechanisms, such as plant uptake and denitrification maximization in buffer zones, few have studied the effects that different soil management treatments have on drainage rates. The application of chloride tracer to soils under six different vegetative treatments from two differing soil textures produced breakthrough curves highlighting the dominant flow mechanisms for each management practice. Of the 18 breakthrough tracers determined, 9 exhibited a rapid macropore hydrology, 6 intermediate mesopore through-flow and three slow micropore flow. Solute breakthrough flow rate was significant between all vegetation and soil treatments (P< 0.05), indicating that both play an important role in the determination of drainage flow pathways and transport speed. Vegetation such as scrub, with a large root network, led to increased soil porosity, significantly increasing the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the maximum peak drainage rates of the soil. On the other hand, maize and grass treatments, with smaller and less dense root networks, exhibited lower soil porosity and hydraulic conductivity, increasing solute residence time within the soil matrix and hence a longer lag time to peak effluent concentration. Although many of the treatments on each soil texture were different, and so could not be directly compared, results suggested that optimal treatments were soil specific, but that grassed and maize buffer strips, on a soil with low saturated hydraulic conductivity, would provide the best compromise at mitigating solute drainage whilst maintaining management practicality.

AB  - Twelve small watersheds in central Iowa were used to evaluate the effectiveness of prairie filter strips (PFS) in trapping sediment from agricultural runoff. Four treatments with PFS of different size and location (100% rowcrop, 10% PFS of total watershed area at footslope, 10% PFS at footslope and in contour strips, 20% PFS at footslope and in contour strips) arranged in a balanced incomplete block design were seeded in July 2007. All watersheds were in bromegrass (Bromus L.) for at least 10 yr before treatment establishment. Cropped areas were managed under a no-till, 2-yr corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max. (L.) Merr.] rotation beginning in 2007. About 38 to 85% of the total sediment export from cropland occurred during the early growth stage of rowcrop due to wet field conditions and poor ground cover. The greatest sediment load was observed in 2008 due to the initial soil disturbance and gradually decreased thereafter. The mean annual sediment yield through 2010 was 0.36 and 8.30 Mg ha(-1) for the watersheds with and without PFS, respectively, a 96% sediment trapping efficiency for the 4-yr study period. The amount and distribution of PFS had no significant impact on runoff and sediment yield, probably due to the relatively large width (37-78 m) of footslope PFS. The findings suggest that incorporation of PFS at the footslope position of annual rowcrop systems provides an effective approach to reducing sediment loss in runoff from agricultural watersheds under a no-till system.

AB  - Vegetative filters (VF) are used to remove sediment and other pollutants from overland flow. When modeling the hydrology of VF, it is often assumed that overland flow is planar but our research indicates that it can be two-dimensional with converging and diverging pathways. Our hypothesis is that flow convergence will negatively influence the sediment trapping capability of VF The objectives were to develop a two-dimensional modeling approach for estimating sediment trapping in VF and to investigate the impact of converging overland flow on sediment trapping by VF In this study, the performance of a VF that has field-scale flow path lengths with uncontrolled flow direction was quantified using field experiments and hydrologic modeling. Simulations of water flow processes were performed using the physically based, distributed model MIKE SHE. A modeling approach that predicts sediment trapping and accounts for converging and diverging flow was developed based on the University of Kentucky sediment filtration model. The results revealed that as flow convergence increases, filter performance decreases, and the impacts are greater at higher flow rates and shorter filter lengths. Convergence that occurs in the contributing field (in-field) upstream of the buffer had a slightly greater impact than convergence that occurred in the filter (in-filter). An area-based convergence ratio was defined that relates the actual flow area in a VF to the theoretical flow area without flow convergence. When the convergence ratio was 0.70, in-filter convergence caused the sediment trapping efficiency to be reduced from 80% for the planar flow condition to 64% for the converging flow condition. When an equivalent convergence occurred in-field, the sediment trapping efficiency was reduced to 57%. Thus, not only is convergence important but the location where convergence occurs can also be important.

AB  - The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) under its Continuous Enrollment Conservation Reserve Program (CRIP) has actively promoted establishment of conservation buffers. Although these programs are intended to benefit wildlife in addition to protecting soil and water resources, benefits to grassland birds may be compromised by narrow widths, presence of woody vegetation, and high predation pressure. During 2001 and 2002, we surveyed breeding grassland birds and searched for nests in 33 CRP filter strips that varied in planting mixture (cool-season vs. warm-season grasses) and adjacent edge type (non-wooded vs. wooded). The most abundant species in filter strips were red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), dickcissel (Spiza americana), song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), and common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas). Relative abundances of birds and nests were similar between cool-season and warm-season planting mixtures. Dickcissels and red-winged blackbirds and their nests were relatively less abundant at wooded than non-wooded sites. Our nest Success estimates generally were low in all treatments, and nest success varied little with the variables we studied. predation was the major cause of nest failure; 62% of all nests were depredated. Although the Most common birds using filter strips are generalists, filter strips also have potential to provide breeding habitat for some species of management concern.

AB  - A substantial honeybee decline is being observed worldwide. Agricultural intensification and loss of wild floral resources rank among the main factors contributing to this decline. Landscape enhancement of floral resources has been proposed as an agro-environmental scheme intended to provide honeybees with compensatory food sources in intensive agrosystems. Floral scheme efficiency has rarely been evaluated with respect to landscape context. In this study, we developed and validated a modeling tool to delineate the landscape areas likely to be associated with higher efficiency of floral enhancement schemes. In particular, the proximity of some landscape elements used by honeybees, either as foraging habitat or as visual landmark for orientation, may partly determine floral scheme efficiency. We investigated this issue using resource selection functions (RSFs), i.e. models that aim to predict the occurrence of foraging honeybees at floral patches as a function of the presence of keystone landscape elements in their proximity. However, deciding which landscape elements are effectively in the proximity or not is mostly a matter of subjectivity. The novelty of our approach resides in its use of a distance-weighting function to explicitly account for the spatial location of surrounding landscape elements. In that respect, a distance function should be scaled on movement patterns of foraging organisms. Herein, we inferred movement patterns from the autocorrelative properties of honeybee foraging activity. This modeling approach was developed on Phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia) field margin strips, a typical "honeybee-friendly" floral scheme. A foraging survey conducted on 170 Phacelia plots (2 m x 2 m) from 17 Phacelia strips, all positioned within the foraging range of an experimental apiary, revealed that (i) the floral scheme efficiency is positively influenced by the presence of linear landscape elements such as hedgerows and forest edges, but negatively affected by the presence of alternative floral resources, and that (ii) weighting the relative importance of those landscape elements by incorporating a distance function into models considerably improved their predictive power. This modeling tool has the potential to help land managers optimizing their financial investment by avoiding low-efficiency landscape areas, or favoring high-efficiency ones, at the time of planning floral enhancement schemes.

AB  - Gross rainfall (PG), net rainfall and stemflow were measured for nearly 3 years in two hedgerows in southern England. The width of the zone where net rainfall was affected by the hedgerows was equivalent to about two hedgerow heights. Rainfall interception was calculated as the difference between the volume of water, from gross rainfall, that would have reached the ground of the sampling area (which also included areas outside the canopy) without the presence of a hedgerow and the actual amount of net rainfall plus stemflow. Averaged over both hedgerows the interception loss during the period of full leaf cover was 57% of PG if related to the ground area covered by the hedgerow canopies or 24% of PG if related to the total ground area affected by the presence of the hedgerows. For the leafless period, the respective values were 49 and 19%. Stemflow constituted a small part in the water balance of the hedgerows and equalled 0.2% of PG in the summer and 0.5% of PG in the winter. Interception storage capacity, if related to projected canopy area, was 2.6 mm during the growing season and 1.2 mm in the leafless hedgerows. During many small rainstorms, which were often associated with high windspeeds, the hedgerows intercepted more rainwater than the amount that would have fallen on the ground covered by them without their presence. This caused the coefficient of free throughfall, when calculated per unit projected canopy area, to be negative. The original Gash [Gash, J.H.C., 1979. An analytical model of rainfall interception by forests. Quart. J. R. Meteorol. Soc. 105, 43-55] analytical model of rainfall interception was parameterised for the hedgerows and tested using data that had not been included in the parameterisation process. The Gash model predicted the interception loss of hedgerows from daily rainfall data with reasonable accuracy. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wireworms, the larvae of click beetles are world-wide pests of arable and vegetable crops. Many studies have shown that arthropods are influenced by landscape context. Therefore, for successful wireworm risk assessment, it is important to gain more information on relationships between landscape structure and wireworm infestation level. The aim of this study was to investigate if different landscape variables are related to wireworm infestation, represented by the proportion of wireworm damaged potato tubers. Based on aerial photographs and field surveys landscape variables, such as landscape composition, landscape complexity and ecological variables were characterised around 14 randomly selected potato field plots alongside the gradient from the lower warm-dry 'Weinviertel' (region 1) to the cool-humid 'Waldviertel' (region 2) in the North-East of Austria at three scales (1, 9 and 25 ha). Relationships between landscape variables and wireworm damage ratings were described by Spearman correlations coefficients. Our results showed that wireworm damage was higher in region 2 than in region 1 and tended to be higher in soils with higher sand content. Among the tested landscape variables only landscape composition, especially grassy field margins were significantly positively correlated with wireworm damage at the 25 ha scale. In areas with high proportion of such grassy habitats, farmers should pay more attention to field characteristics, such as sand content in soil, and management, like crop rotation. Further investigations on appropriate management regimes for grassy landscape elements suppressing wireworm populations but ensuring the maintenance of natural pest control should be conducted.

AB  - Breeding ecology of long-tailed his Aegithalos caudatus in Northwestern Spain: phenology, nest-site selection, nest success and helping behaviour. The population density, phenology, nest-site selection, nest success and helping behaviour of breeding long-tailed tits Aegithalos caudatus was studied in NW Spain during 2002-2007. The fieldwork was conducted in an area of 500 ha between Palacio and Pedrtin (42 degrees 43' 26 '' 42 degrees 46' 15 '' S-N, 5 degrees 29' 58 '' 5 degrees 30' 55 '' E-W, 900-1,000 m a.s.l.), in the Torio river valley, Leon province. Population density was estimated through line transects and mapping. Records of pairs carrying nest material in their bills, building a nest and carrying food in their bills were distributed in 10-day intervals. Nest-site selection was estimated using the Jacobs' index. To determine nest success, only those found in the early stages of building were considered. To establish provisioning rates, each nest with nestlings was observed for a minimum of 3 h. The number of helpers at each nest each day was deduced from the maximum number of different adults feeding nestlings at the same time, subtracting the two individuals that formed the pair. Population density was c. 6-10 birds/10 ha. Winter flock break-up and pair formation usually occurred from the beginning of February, nest building during 11 March-10 April, laying and incubation during 11-30 April, and the presence of nestlings throughout May. Probably few pairs renested after failing to breed. The most typical habitats in the nest surroundings were hedgerows and oak woods. Two thirds of the nests were built in shrubs and the rest in trees. Rubus brambles were highly preferred plant species for supporting nests. Nest success was very low (c. 18%), and nest failure occurred mainly before hatching due to predation. No cases of helping behaviour were recorded prior to the nestling stage. Cooperative breeding was verified in 60% of the nests, and it occurred in all the habitats and vegetation strata. The final number of helpers per nest was between one and four, usually one or two. Values over 40 visits to the nest in one hour were only recorded when there was at least one helper, and over 50 visits with two or more helpers. In conclusion, (i) optimal habitat conditions for the long-tailed tit were found in the study area; (ii) several characteristics of the observed breeding ecology coincided with those well-described in similar habitats in the UK; (iii) the same determining factors for helping behaviour probably occurred in both locations, with great importance of low breeding success. Research is needed on the social organization and breeding system of this species in more areas in its wide distribution range.

AB  - Hedgerows are considered habitat corridors for Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris). However, in north Iberia, a red squirrel population resides in hedgerows separating meadows. This study assesses seasonal microhabitat selection in this peculiar squirrel population. The detection rate was higher in winter and autumn than in spring and summer because of the confluence of different biological and environmental factors. Red squirrels were mainly arboreal, though they used the ground to some degree throughout the year. The height at which individuals were seen in shrubs/trees was maximum in spring related to intensive use of high poplars. A seasonal variation in plant selection was found. Red squirrels selected oaks, ivy and poplars positively in winter, poplars, ashes and willows in spring, hazels, wild cherries and willows in summer, and hazels, ashes and willows in autumn, linked with shelter, nest-site and food requirements. Conservation of dense hedgerow networks with a high diversity of shrub and tree species is encouraged.

AB  - Vegetative environmental buffers (VEB) are a potentially low cost sustainable odor mitigation strategy, but there is little to no data supporting their effectiveness. Wind tunnel experiments and field monitoring were used to determine the effect VEB had on wind flow patterns within a swine facility. Particle and odorous compound concentrations were monitored before and after the VEB. Wind tunnel experiments indicated that building orientation had about the same impact on air flow patterns as the combined buildings and VEB. Field monitoring studies revealed that air flow patterns at a swine facility were dynamic showing intense instability during the heat of the day, but stable air in the evening hours indicating that air during the day was controlled by vertical movement into the atmosphere while in the evening air patterns show a collapse mostly horizontal movement. Total particle counts before and after the vegetative buffer were reduced by over 40% and odorous compound concentrations for volatile fatty acids, phenol and indole compounds were reduced by 40-60%. Plant material taken from trees in the vegetative buffer showed no significant loading gradients between materials facing the swine facility and those opposite the swine facility. There were significantly higher loadings of odorous VFAs, phenolic, and indole compounds on plant material for samples taken from 2.7. m compared to samples taken from either 0.6 or 1.3. m indicating that vertical transport was major transport mechanism for odor at the swine facility. © 2011.

AB  - Riparian buffers are designed as management practices to increase infiltration and reduce surface runoff and transport of sediment and nonpoint source pollutants from crop fields to adjacent streams. Achieving these ecosystem service goals depends, in part, on their ability to remove water from the soil via transpiration. In these systems, edges between crop fields and trees of the buffer systems can create advection processes, which could influence water use by trees. We conducted a field study in a riparian buffer system established in 1994 under a humid temperate climate, located in the Corn Belt region of the Midwestern U.S. (Iowa). The goals were to estimate stand level transpiration by the riparian buffer, quantify the controls on water use by the buffer system, and determine to what extent advective energy and tree position within the buffer system influence individual tree transpiration rates. We primarily focused on the water use response (determined with the Heat Ratio Method) of one of the dominant species (Acer saccharinum) and a subdominant (Juglans nigra). A few individuals of three additional species (Quercus bicolor, Betula nigra, Platanus occidentalis) were monitored over a shorter time period to assess the generality of responses. Meteorological stations were installed along a transect across the riparian buffer to determine the microclimate conditions. The differences found among individuals were attributed to differences in species sap velocities and sapwood depths, location relative to the forest edge and prevailing winds and canopy exposure and dominance. Sapflow rates for A. saccharinum trees growing at the SE edge (prevailing winds) were 39% greater than SE interior trees and 30% and 69% greater than NW interior and edge trees, respectively. No transpiration enhancement due to edge effect was detected in the subdominant J. nigra. The results were interpreted as indicative of advection effects from the surrounding crops. Further, significant differences were document in sapflow rates between the five study species, suggesting that selection of species is important for enhancing specific riparian buffer functions. However, more information is needed on water use patterns among diverse species growing under different climatic and biophysical conditions to assist policy and management decisions regarding effective buffer design.

AB  - Summary: Intensively managed annual cropping systems have produced high crop yields but have often produced significant ecosystem services alteration, in particular hydrologic regulation loss. Reconversion of annual agricultural systems to perennial vegetation can lead to hydrologic function restoration, but its effect is still not well understood. Therefore, our objective was to assess the effects of strategic introduction of different amounts and location of native prairie vegetation (NPV) within agricultural landscapes on hydrological regulation. The study was conducted in Iowa (USA), and consisted of a fully balanced, replicated, incomplete block design whereby 12 zero-order ephemeral flow watersheds received four treatments consisting of varying proportions (0%, 10%, and 20%) of prairie vegetation located in different watershed positions (footslope vs. contour strips). Runoff volume and rate were measured from 2008 to 2010 (April–October) with an H-Flume installed in each catchment, and automated ISCO samplers. Over the entire study period, we observed a total of 129 runoff events with an average runoff volume reduction of 37% based on the three treatments with NPV compared to watersheds with row crops. We observed a progressively greater reduction across the 3years of the study as the perennial strips became established with the greatest differences among treatments occurring in 2010. The differences among the watersheds were attributed mainly to NPV amount and position, with the 10% NPV at footslope treatment having the greatest runoff reduction probably because the portion of NPV filter strip that actually contacted watershed runoff was greater with the 10% NPV at footslope. We observed greater reductions in runoff in spring and fall likely because perennial prairie plants were active and crops were absent or not fully established. High antecedent soil moisture sometimes led to little benefit of the NPV treatments but in general the NPV treatments were effective during both small and large events. We conclude that, small amounts of NPV strategically incorporated into corn-soybean watersheds in the Midwest US can be used to effectively reduce runoff.

AB  - Monoculture crop production and prevailing farming practices have greatly reduced perennial plants on the landscape and nearly eliminated native Iowa prairie vegetation. The STRIPs (Science-based Trials of Row crops Integrated with Prairies) project is a watershed-scale experiment at the Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge, in Jasper County, Iowa, US, in which strips of prairie vegetation were planted within watersheds of corn ( Zea mays ) and soybean (Glycine max ) production to aid in soil and water conservation. The project includes 12 0.5- to 3.2-ha watersheds. Nine watersheds included buffer strips in one of three design treatments that varied the number and position of strips and/or the proportion of the watershed converted to buffer and three watersheds were 100% crop. The present study investigated: (1) If the design of prairie buffer strips influenced their vegetation; (2) If the vegetation of prairie buffer strips shifted over time; (3) If prairie buffer strips caused a weed problem in adjacent crop fields. From 2008-2011, the identity and percent cover of plant species within the buffer strips were surveyed, and from 2009-2011, the identity and percent cover of weed species within the cropped areas of the watersheds were surveyed. Differences among treatments and among years in plant species diversity, percent cover, and composition were analyzed using ANOVA and NMS. The design of buffer strips did not influence plant species diversity or composition; however, buffer strip vegetation did shift over time. In 2008, the strips had 38 species (in 6 m 2 ) with 37% of the total plant cover composed of perennial species and 22% composed of native perennial species. By 2011, the strips had 55 species (in 6 m2 ) with 90% of the total plant cover composed of perennial species and 58% composed of native perennial species. In addition, NMS analyses indicated that the buffer strip plant community shifted from annual to perennial species. Within the crop, weed species richness and percent cover did not differ among watershed treatments, regardless of whether watersheds contained buffer strips or not. Prairie buffer strips greatly increased plant diversity in the watersheds; 380% more species were found in 6 m 2 of prairie buffer than in 6 m2 of cropland. Within four years of establishment, the buffer strip vegetation was predominantly perennial and native species, the target vegetation for both ecohydrological functions (i.e., erosion control) and for conservation. Furthermore, weed species richness or prevalence did not differ between watersheds that incorporated prairie buffer strips versus 100% crop watersheds. Therefore, converting 10-20% of arable cropland to prairie buffer strips successfully reintroduced perennial species and conserved native Iowa prairie without causing a weed problem in adjacent crops.

AB  - Crop production and prevailing farming practices have greatly reduced biodiversity and nearly eliminated native prairie in the central USA. Restoring small areas of prairie on cropland may increase plant biodiversity and native species abundance while benefiting the cropland. In Iowa, we incorporated buffer strips composed of prairie vegetation within catchments (0.5 ha to 3.2 ha land areas in which precipitation drained to a collection point at the slope bottom) used for corn (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max) production. We planted prairie buffer strips in three designs, varying the proportion of the catchment converted to buffer and/or the continuity of the buffer. Within the catchments, we determined the identity and percent cover of buffer strip plant species during 2008-2011 and of weed species in cropped areas during 2009-2011. We found 380% more species in 6 m² of buffer strip than in 6 m2 of crop, indicating that the presence of buffer strips greatly increased catchment diversity. Plant community composition did not differ among the three buffer designs. Despite being surrounded by cropland, the buffer vegetation was dominated by native perennial species-the targeted vegetation type for both ecohydrological functions (e.g., erosion control) and native species conservation- within four years of establishment. Furthermore, weed species richness and prevalence did not differ between cropped areas of catchments with buffer strips and cropped areas of catchments without buffer strips. These results indicate that converting 10-20% of cropland to prairie buffer strips successfully reintroduced perennial species characteristic of native prairie without increasing weeds in adjacent crops.

AB  - The effects of wind protection on growth and total and marketable yields of snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) planted at 2-week intervals through the 1994 and 1995 growing seasons were examined. Research was conducted under nonirrigated conditions at the Shelterbelt Research Area, Univ. of Nebraska Agricultural Research and Development Center (ARDC) near Mead. 'Strike' (white-seeded) and 'Rushmore' (dark-seeded) were planted in locations sheltered from wind stress by tree windbreaks (shelterbelts) and in locations exposed to normal winds using a randomized complete-block design with a split-split plot arrangement of treatments. Air temperature, soil temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction were monitored. Detailed microclimate conditions at bean canopy level in sheltered and exposed plots are provided in the text. Wind speed in sheltered areas averaged 36% of open field wind speed in 1994 and 43% of open wind speed in 1995. Soil temperatures were higher in sheltered areas than in exposed areas. Microclimate changes due to shelter had no effect on the percent seedling emergence or number of days to emergence. Plants in shelter had significantly higher total dry weight and leaf area index and greater total internode length than exposed plants. Both total and marketable yields were increased significantly by production under sheltered conditions each year. Planting date and cultivar also had a significant impact on average pod yields. No interactions between shelter and planting date, or shelter and cultivar, were found in either year. The results suggest that wind protection provided by shelterbelts (tree windbreaks) can increase pod yields of snap bean both early and late in the season. This may result in greater profit for the grower due to a tendency for higher prices at these times.

AB  - Abstract: Grassy field margins are thought to be an important feature for a variety of species in arable landscapes. However, not many studies address the impact of such margins in arable landscapes on the abundance of macro-invertebrates in arable fields. We estimated the abundance of earthworms, gastropods and carabids in fields with and without a grassy margin. Additionally, fields were sampled along the edge and further in the field. From our findings we can conclude that the presence of grassy field margins in arable landscapes increases the abundance of carabids and earthworms but decreases the abundance of gastropods. These effects were mainly noticeable on the edge of the field, but appear to be occurring further in the field as well.

AB  - The relationship between density and richness of herbivorous insects in alfalfa fields, and the amount (total length) of woody field border in the landscapes surrounding the fields was studied. Insects (predominantly herbivorous) were sampled in 35 alfalfa fields in 1995 and 24 fields in 1996, and the total length of woody field borders within the 1 km radius circular landscape surrounding each field was measured. There was no effect of amount of woody border in the landscape on insect density. There was a significant positive effect of amount of woody border in the landscape on overall family richness of insects in the alfalfa fields. The results of this study suggest that woody borders increase diversity but not density of herbivorous insects within crop fields in agro-ecosystems. This suggests that woody borders play a role in maintaining biodiversity in agro-ecosystems, and that this role extends beyond the borders themselves, into the crop fields.

AB  - - In many European countries agri-environment funding can improve ecosystem services, including the adoption of conservation biocontrol, through the creation of habitats that encourage beneficial arthropods. Predatory beetles are amongst the most numerous and diverse arthropods present in arable fields. The primary ecosystem services provided by predatory beetles are in biological control and food chain maintenance as they are a key resource for many higher organisms. However, to be effective biological control agents, able to respond quickly to wherever a pest infestation occurs, then they must be sufficiently abundant and widely distributed. Conservation biocontrol utilising predatory beetles has focussed on the impact of species that overwinter in adjacent field boundaries, although those overwintering within fields are often more abundant. If the abundance and distribution of predatory beetles is to be maximised then further knowledge of their spatial dynamics is required to ensure habitats are arranged appropriately. The spatio-temporal dynamics of boundary and field overwintering species was measured across 64 ha encompassing six fields and for three consecutive years using a grid of 973 pitfall traps. Boundary species were more numerous in spring (May and June) whereas more field species were captured in July. The species composition was comprised of relatively few taxa. Boundary species occurred in small patches that were distributed across the fields in spring, but were only found close to the margins in July. Patches persisted in some locations over two years. Field species occurred in larger patches, spread across particular fields and these were stable within years and to some extent between years. Game-cover strips were attractive to boundary species in the spring and summer and did not effect predator distribution in the adjacent crop.

AB  - Abstract: The impact of two predatory guilds, epigeal and aerial natural enemies, on levels of cereal aphid control in winter wheat was examined on farms with contrasting proportions of grass margins, one of the most popular agri-environment options in England. In year 1, by 14d after inoculation the aerial natural enemies alone had caused substantial reductions (88%) in numbers of cereal aphids compared to where no natural enemies were present. In contrast, epigeal predators achieved a 31% reduction, although this reached 88% after 28d. In year 2, both aerial and epigeal natural enemies achieved over 87% control after 14d. Aerial natural enemies were largely comprised of predatory Diptera and Linyphiidae (Araneae). Levels of control were positively related to the proportion of linear grass margins within 250, 500 and 750m radii of the study arenas. There was weaker evidence that hedgerows decreased aphid control by epigeal predators. This study demonstrated that an agri-environment option can be used to improve an ecosystem service on arable farmland.

AB  - Abstract: Studies demonstrating the empirical impact of natural enemies on pests and the effect of habitat manipulation are required if farmers are to be persuaded to adopt conservation biocontrol. The relative abundance of different natural enemy guilds were manipulated to investigate their impact on grain aphids (Sitobion avenae) and whether the establishment of wider field margins increased levels of control. The impact of epigeal and flying aphid predators, in isolation and together, on cereal aphids was tested in five fields with standard field margins (ca. 2m wide) and in five fields with wide margins (ca. 6m wide). Flying predators alone were as effective as all predators in controlling the grain aphid and reduced aphids by 90% and 93%, whereas epigeal predators alone achieved a reduction of only 40% and 18% in fields with standard and wide margins respectively. Levels of parasitism measured by counts of aphid mummies were relatively low (⩽12%) on all sampling occasions. There was no evidence that the wide field margins increased natural enemies within the adjacent field as measured using pitfall traps, suction sampling and sticky traps. The wide field margins were considered to have no benefit for biocontrol because flying predators capable of moving between fields were primarily responsible or the amount of uncropped land suitable for natural enemies was not a limiting factor in the landscape.

AB  - Agri-environment scheme habitats can support declining pollinators, but optimum approaches for deployment remain uncertain. The impact of three management treatments (project-, farm-managed and organic farming) alongside habitat type, quantity of uncropped land removed from production and spatial configuration (strips or blocks) on wild bees, butterflies and hoverflies were investigated. Pollinators were assessed on 28 sites over three years, along boundaries representing site scale (ca. 100-ha) and within project-managed (floristically enhanced grass, wild bird seed mix, insect rich cover and natural regeneration) or farm-managed wildlife habitats (typically grass margins or game cover). Project-management resulted in the creation of the most widely utilised habitats (floristically enhanced grass and wild bird seed mixtures), but these may attract wild bees away from boundaries whereas butterfly abundance (Lycaenidae and Pieridae) was enhanced along field boundaries. Organic management and spatial configuration of habitats had little impact. Proportion of uncropped land per site was positively related to Cuckoo bee, Lycaenidae and Satyridae density and butterfly species richness at site scale and on the density of several bee species, total wild bees, Pieridae and total butterflies in wildlife habitats. The mean abundance of uncropped land was 3.6% and at least double this was required to double the abundance of wild bees and butterflies. Wild bee densities were highest in field boundaries and floristically enhanced grass and positively correlated with flower cover. Butterflies sought habitats containing their larval food plants and high flower cover. Hoverflies were most abundant in the insect rich cover. Wildlife habitat in agricultural landscapes may be insufficient and additional, diverse habitats are needed to encourage pollinators. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pollinators are traditionally thought to perceive non-flowering crop fields as hostile landscape matrix. In this study, we show that landscapes composed of higher proportions of organic crop fields support more bee species at greater abundances in fallow strips. An increase in organic cropping in the surrounding landscape from 5% to 20% enhanced bee species richness in fallow strips by 50%, density of solitary bees by 60% and bumble bee density by 150%. Bee species richness and bumble bee density responded strongest to organic cropping in landscape sectors with 500 m radius, solitary bee density in landscape sectors with 250 m radius. The most likely source of these results is that crop and noncrop habitats are strongly connected via bee foraging at the landscape scale. It seems likely that bees depending on nesting sites in fallow strips benefited from the more abundant flower resources provided by broadleaved weeds in organic crop fields. We conclude that the incorporation of organic crop fields into conventionally managed agricultural landscapes can provide food resources needed to sustain greater pollinator species richness in noncrop habitats.

AB  - Corridors that connect otherwise isolated habitats have often been proposed as a management strategy to mitigate negative effects of habitat fragmentation. Non-crop corridors may have the potential to enhance the connectivity for arthropod predators in cropland landscapes, especially for species that require multiple habitats, such as cavity-nesting wasps which use wooded habitat for nesting and grassland habitat for foraging. However, the effects of corridors in nonexperimental landscapes have been rarely examined. We studied the species richness and abundance of cavity-nesting wasps and their parasitoids in standardized trap nests located in three habitat types (forest edge, hedge, grass strip) and in three grass-strip types (connected to a forest edge, slightly isolated, highly isolated from a forest edge). Species richness and the abundance of wasps (Hymenoptera: Sphecidae, Eumenidae, Pompilidae) were highest at forest edges, which provide natural nesting sites, and lowest in grass strips, with few natural nesting sites. Wasp abundance in grass strips connected to forest edges was 270% higher than in slightly isolated grass strips and 600% higher than in highly isolated grass strips. The abundance of caterpillar-hunting eumenid wasps was 600% higher in connected grass strips than in slightly and highly isolated grass strips. Species richness of wasps was enhanced by 180% in connected grass strips compared to highly isolated grass strips. Parasitism rates were not directly influenced by habitat or grass-strip type, but increased with increasing parasitoid diversity that was higher at forest edges than in grass strips. We conclude that grass-strip corridors enhance the colonization of nesting sites, presumably by facilitating wasp movements. In agricultural landscapes, where nesting sites are limited and food availability changes frequently, rapid colonization of nests may enhance population viability. Higher wasp abundance in connected nesting sites may be directly linked to higher biocontrol of pest caterpillars within the foraging range around nests. Although grass strips can reduce the negative effects of habitat fragmentation, non-crop habitats such as forest habitats and hedges providing nesting sites are required within the home range of wasps to allow reproduction in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - P>1. Habitat destruction and increasing land use intensity result in habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, and subsequently in the loss of species diversity. The fact that these factors are often highly confounded makes disentangling their effects extremely difficult, if not impossible, and their relative impact on species loss is mostly speculative. 2. In a two-year study, we analysed the relative importance of changed landscape composition (increased areas of cropped habitats), reduced habitat connectivity and reduced habitat quality on nest colonization of cavity-nesting bees, wasps and their parasitoids. We selected 23 pairs of conventional and organic wheat fields in the centre of landscape circles (500 m radius) differing in edge densities (landscape configuration) and % non-crop habitats (landscape composition). Standardized trap nests were established in the field centres and in neighbouring permanent fallow strips (making a total of 92 nesting sites). 3. Factors at all three scales affected nest colonization. While bees were enhanced by high proportions of non-crop habitat in the landscape, wasps profited from high edge densities, supporting our hypothesis that wasps are enhanced by connecting corridors. Colonization of herbivore-predating wasps was lower in field centres than in fallow strips for conventional sites, but not for organic sites, indicating a fallow-like connectivity value of organic fields. The relative importance of habitat type and farming system varied among functional groups suggesting that their perception of crop-non-crop boundaries or the availability of their food resources differed. 4. Local and landscape effects on parasitoids were mainly mediated by their hosts. Parasitism rates were marginally affected by local factors. A specialist parasitoid was more sensitive to high land use intensity than its host, whereas generalist parasitoids were less sensitive. 5. We conclude that the conversion of cropland into non-crop habitat may not be a sufficiently successful strategy to enhance wasps or other species that suffer more from isolation than from habitat loss. Interestingly, habitat connectivity appeared to be enhanced by both higher edge densities and by organic field management. Thus, we conclude that high proportions of conventionally managed and large crop fields threaten pollination and biological control services at a landscape scale.

AB  - Soil from 403 hedgerow, roadside verge, woodland, heathland or field sites was assessed for presence of entomopathogenic rhabditid nematodes with a Galleria larva baiting technique. Steinernematids were recovered from 48.6% of the sites but only one site yielded Heterorhabditis sp. The species recovered most frequently was Steinernema bibionis (Bovien). Another unidentified Steinernema sp. was also isolated. Prevalence of steinernematids in the different types of habitat formed a continuum so that roadside verges harboured them most often while heathland sites yielded them least often. Mean soil temperatures at 5 cm were about 15°C in fields and verges, 13°C in hedgerows and heathland and 12°C in woodland. Prevalence of the nematodes varied in different parts of Britain and was influenced by soil type. They were associated with calcareous soils, especially those with a calcareous subsoil horizon. Soils which are periodically or seasonally water-logged were suitable. Soils enriched by humus and hence high in organic matter frequently harboured the nematodes and some suitable soils had significant clay contents or subsoils high in clay. It appears that the two steinernematids are relatively unspecialized species, occurring in diverse habitats and soil types and are adapted to cooler temperatures.

AB  - This four-year study investigated whether partitioning intensively managed grass crop fields by non-fertilized, extensively managed permanent strips created new habitats for semi-natural grassland plants and contributed to increased plant species richness. The strips were set aside in the grass crop or ploughed at the start of the experiment, and either uncut or cut each autumn. Uncut strips became species-poor and dominated by Elymus repens. Cut strips contained more species than the grass crop but most were generalists or woody species. A few semi-natural species were present in non-experimental field margins bordering the grass crop fields, but few colonized the strips. Setting aside non-fertilized strips is not sufficient to increase plant species richness; further management, e.g., annual cutting and removal of plant material is required. Strips created on fertile soils may be a poor habitat for several semi-natural species and are not likely to contribute to an increased plant species richness of any significance.

AB  - Creation of permanent, semi-natural strips may contribute to increased plant diversity in agricultural areas if they function as habitats for new species. Non-fertilized strips that were ploughed and either unsown or sown with a grass and meadow herb seed mixture were created in a grass crop field, in order to test the establishment of several meadow herb species, to investigate to what extent creation of sown and unsown strips increased plant species numbers and the number of meadow herbs, and to assess the contribution of species dispersal from an adjacent semi-natural field margin into the created strips. The strips were cut each autumn and plant material removed. Plant species composition was studied in permanent quadrats in the strips and in the surrounding grass crop during four years. Four of the 22 sown meadow herb species did not establish in the strips. Sowing increased both the number of meadow herbs and plant species diversity (calculated by the Shannon index) compared with the grass crop. Creating unsown strips did not increase the number of meadow herbs or plant species diversity. The created strips were colonized by woody species originating from the adjacent semi-natural field margin, but the meadow herbs present in the field margin did not colonize the strips. In the short term, establishment of sown strips would improve biodiversity locally. However, such strips will not serve as suitable habitats for the most vulnerable meadow herbs, and thus creation of new strips cannot compensate for loss of existing species-rich, semi-natural habitats.

AB  - In 1991, the spatial and temporal distribution of flying insects was investigated by yellow water traps m an organic rye field and an adjacent hedge and forest edge at Obere Lobau, Vienna. The total diversity of insect groups was higher near the adjacent habitats than in the central parts of the field. Likewise, most antagonistic groups (e.g. chalcidoid and proctotrupoid wasps, tachinid flies, spnecid wasps, mirid bugs) showed higher activity-densities alongside the adjacent habitats than in the open field. The potentially harmful aphids predominated in the marginal areas of the crop. Thysanopterans were caught most abundantly in the central parts of the field.

AB  - 1. Field margins within intensively managed ecosystems are often seen as a last refuge for biodiversity, and are typically targeted with measures within many agri-environment schemes. Grassland accounts for 81 million ha of land within the EU; however, the ecology of field margins associated with permanent grassland has not been well studied. 2. This study investigated the effects of experimental field margin measures on hymenopteran parasitoid communities over a 5-year period. Hymenopteran parasitoids were chosen because they occupy high trophic levels, feed on a diverse range of plant and invertebrate hosts, and are considered good indicators of arthropod diversity. Establishment methods included: fencing, natural regeneration, and reseeding with a wildflower mixture, at three margin widths. 3. Field margin establishment method had a significant effect on abundance of parasitoids. Establishment method did not have a significant effect on parasitoid genera diversity, but did affect parasitoid community composition. Margin width had no significant impact on parasitoid communities. 4. Grazing had a significant negative effect on parasitoid genus richness and community structure. This suggests that structural diversity of vegetation plays an important role in parasitoid community structure. 5. Plant species richness did not significantly affect parasitoid abundance or genera richness. Noxious species within plots resulted in a significantly greater abundance and diversity of parasitoids and of idiobionts in particular. 6. Where plant species richness is limited, simple measures such as fencing of narrow field margins may be as effective at increasing parasitoid taxon richness and abundance (indicators of arthropod richness and abundance) as expensive measures such as reseeding and wider margin widths.

AB  - A farm-scale study was conducted from 2000 to 2004 to determine the effectiveness of grass-forest vegetated buffers in assimilating nitrogen (N) from overland flow application of swine lagoon effluent. The rationale for the study was that replicated buffer plot studies had shown that vegetated buffers will effectively assimilate N, but it was not known whether or not they would work at a larger scale. The study was conducted on a commercial farm near Tifton, Georgia. Wastewater was pumped from a single-stage anaerobic lagoon to vegetated buffers composed of grass and mature or newly planted pines. The buffers approximated 60 m in length by 90 m in width. The upper 10 m of each buffer was in grass, while the downslope area was in mature or newly planted pines. Six buffers were instrumented for wastewater application and water quality monitoring. Two buffers received wastewater at a 1X rate (600 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), two at a 3/4X rate (450 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), and two served as controls. The wastewater was applied to the 10 m grassed portion of the buffers. Transects of shallow groundwater wells starting at the grass-forest interface and running downslope were used to monitor water quality N. The study showed mixed results concerning N assimilation by the buffers. Upslope land use changes by the producer during the study added significant N inputs to one set of buffers, and they were unable to assimilate sufficient N from both these inputs and the wastewater to protect shallow groundwater quality. In contrast, almost all samplings of shallow groundwater under the buffers receiving N only from the overland flow applied swine lagoon effluent showed nitrate (NO3-N) concentrations 20 and 30 m downslope to be lower than 10 mg L-1 (drinking water standard). On these buffers, NO3-N concentrations in shallow groundwater were near background levels five years after wastewater application commenced. The study indicated that the ratio of buffer area width to wastewater application area width on the landscape should be at least 1:1, and that buffers for protection of water quality should be continuous oil the landscape. It was concluded from the study that buffers call be used at the farm scale to assimilate N from applied wastewater when they are sufficiently wide relative to waste application area, rate, and other N sources at the farm scale.

AB  - Agricultural activities on hillslopes often cause soil erosion and degradation. Permanent vegetation strips on cultivated slopes could be an effective soil conservation technique to reduce erosion. Previous studies showed that cultivated Mahonia aquifolium can be an effective plant for water erosion control. However, no detailed studies have been carried out to evaluate the efficiency of M. aquifolium as a permanent vegetation strip. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of M. aquifolium strips on soil erosion control under various bio-physical conditions with the use of the Revised Morgan-Morgan-Finney model (RMMF). The RMMF model was first calibrated by using measured quantities of surface runoff and validated against soil loss data from M. aquifolium plots. After calibration the model showed erosion to be transport limited process for all M. aquifolium plots and a detachment limited for the bare soil control plot. The model was then used to predict surface runoff and soil loss for various soil types, slope angles and cultivations with and without M. aquifolium strips. The study indicated that the presence of M. aquifolium strips substantially reduced the soil loss rate on all studied crop fields. For steeper slopes with M. aquifolium strips the model predicted a lower soil loss rate than for gentle slopes without strips.

AB  - The ecological development of field corner plantations on arable land in northwest Essex, UK, was studied. Forty plantations, aged between 1 and 15 years, were examined for soil nutrients, ground flora development, tree survival and natural tree regeneration. Plantation soils showed an overall increase in acidity, total nitrogen and total organic carbon compared with adjacent fields, but there was no difference in total phosphorus or potassium. Total nitrogen and organic carbon increased with age of plantation. The overall ground flora consisted of 182 species, but many occured in only a few plantations. The majority of species were competitors and ruderals. The total number of species, and the number of grassland and woodland species, increased with plantation area. Only arable weed species number was related to plantation age (negatively). Canopy closure markedly reduced the number of species in plantations. The presence of good quality hedgerows adjacent to plantations increased their species richness, especially of shade-tolerant herbs. Planted tree survival in individual plantations ranged from 32 to 98% but was generally good (mean 76%). Most losses occured in the first 9 years and were associated with competition with grasses or with adjacent hedgerows. The density of naturally sown seedlings ranged from 0 to 5667 (mean 360) ha-1. There was a correlation between age and the number of suckers, but not seedlings. More seedlings and suckers were found in plantations adjacent to good quality hedgerows. © 1992.

AB  - Riparian buffers are used throughout the world for the protection of water bodies from nonpoint-source nitrogen pollution. Few studies of riparian or treatment wetland denitrification consider the production of nitrous oxide (N2O). The objectives of this research were to ascertain the level of potential N2O production in riparian buffers and identify controlling factors for N2O accumulations within riparian soils of an agricultural watershed in the southeastern Coastal Plain of the USA. Soil samples were obtained from ten sites (site types) with different agronomic management and landscape position. Denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) was measured by the acetylene inhibition method. Nitrous oxide accumulations were measured after incubation with and without acetylene (baseline N2O production). The mean DEA (with acetylene) was 59 microg N2O-N kg(-1) soil h(-1) for all soil samples from the watershed. If no acetylene was added to block conversion of N2O to N2, only 15 microg N2O-N kg(-1) soil h(-1) were accumulated. Half of the samples accumulated no N2O. The highest level of denitrification was found in the soil surface layers and in buffers impacted by either livestock waste or nitrogen from legume production. Nitrous oxide accumulations (with acetylene inhibition) were correlated to soil nitrogen (r2=0.59). Without acetylene inhibition, correlations with soil and site characteristics were lower. Nitrous oxide accumulations were found to be essentially zero, if the soil C/N ratios>25. Soil C/N ratios may be an easily measured and widely applicable parameter for identification of potential hot spots of N2O productions from riparian buffers.

AB  - Riparian zones are recognized as landscape features that buffer streams from pollutants, particularly nitrogen. The objectives of this experiment were to (i) assess denitrification activity within a riparian zone and (ii) determine the influence of physical, chemical, and landscape features on denitrification. This experiment was conducted from 1994 to 1997 in North Carolina on a riparian zone contiguous to a spray field that was heavily loaded with swine lagoon wastewater. Denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) was measured on soils collected from (i) the soil surface, (ii) midway between the soil surface and water table, and (iii) above the water table. The DEA ranged from 3 to 1660 mug N2O-N kg(-1) soil h(-1). The DEA was highest next to the stream and lowest next to the spray field. Nitrate was found to be the limiting factor for denitrification. The DEA generally decreased with soil depth; means for the surface, middle, and bottom depths were 147,83, and 67 mug N2O-N kg(-1)soil h(-1), respectively. These DEA values are higher than those reported for riparian zones adjoining cropland of the southeastern United States, but are lower than those reported for a constructed wetland used for treatment of swine wastewater. Regression analysis indicated that soil total nitrogen was the highest single factor correlated to DEA (r(2) = 0.65). The inclusion of water table depth, soil depth, and distance from the spray field improved the R-2 to 0.86. This riparian zone possessed sufficient soil area with high denitrifying conditions to be a significant factor in the removal of excess nitrogen in the ground water.

AB  - The effects of cultivation methods, pesticide use and perennial grass strips on spider fauna of cereal fields were studied in a large-scale field experiment. The effects of two pesticide regimes (conventional and reduced) on spiders were contrasted with effects of two types of cultivation systems (customary and integrated farming practice). The plots under the conventional pesticide regime were sprayed with herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and growth regulators annually. The plots on reduced pesticide regime were treated only when the control thresholds were exceeded (in 1992 with insecticide and in 1994 with herbicide). The perennial grass strips (sown with a mixture of timothy, meadow fescue, red clover and white clover) at the margins of the treated plots provided an additional element. Seasonal patterns of spider catches were quite synchronous in the field and in the perennial strip. Number of spiders were clearly higher in perennial strips than in the field. Furthermore, the composition of spider fauna differed between cerela plots and perennial grass strips. Lycosidae dominated in grass strips, whereas in cereal fields the family Linyphiidae was common. The dominance of Lycosidae in grass strips increased from year to year. The perennial strips affected the spider abundance of the field; total spider catches and Lycosidae catches, but not Linyphiidae, in pitfalls near the strips were higher than in pitfalls situated further away. However, the effects of pesticide treatments on spider numbers did not depend on the distance from the perennial strip. Reduced pesticide use plots had greater total spider catches than conventional plots in 1992 and 1994. In both years the difference was obvious for more than 3 weeks after insecticide (dimethoate) treatment. In 1992, pirimicarb was nearly harmless to spiders compared to dimethoate. In 1994, the dimethoate treatment (in June) did not decrease clearly the abundance of spiders, but deltamethrin treatment (in July) had dramatic effects on the total spider abundance and the difference was still obvious in the last sampling period. At family level, the effects of pesticide treatments varied between families. Statistically significant differences between pesticide treatments were found in all years in Linyphiidae numbers, but in Lycosidae only in 1994. During the period of 3 years, no differences were found in the numbers of spiders between the two cultivation systems tested.

AB  - The introduction and conservation of field margins have been proposed as an intervention to counteract the decline in farmland biodiversity. However, how these margins can affect the movement of species and individuals (i.e. spillover) of natural enemies between field margins and crop is still unclear. In this work, we investigated the spillover of two different groups of natural enemies: tachinids (Diptera: Tachinidae) and aphidophagous hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae). For comparison we also investigated the response of non-aphidophagous hoverflies. We examined the spillover from two types of field margin (grass margin vs. hedgerow + grass margin) to adjacent maize fields located in landscapes with different proportion of arable land. The spillover of natural enemies was affected by the field margins, but the response varied between insect groups. The spillover of tachinids was higher from the grass margin than from hedgerows, suggesting that the spillover of this group may be related to the low contrast between the vegetation structure of the margin and the crop. In contrast to tachinids, the abundance of aphidophagous hoverflies was higher toward the center of the crop field, independently of the type of field margin. The spillover of non-aphidophagous hoverflies was not affected by the type of field margin. These species were only affected by the landscape composition as their species richness and abundance were higher in landscapes with low amounts of arable land. Measures focusing on the creation and management of field margins need to consider the local contrast between field margins and crops in relation to the life-history traits of different taxa. Es wurde vorgeschlagen, dass Einrichtung und Schutz von Feldrändern dem Rückgang der Biodiversität in der Agrarlandschaft entgegenwirken sollten, aber wie diese Ränder die Bewegung von Arten und Individuen von natürlichen Feinden zwischen Feldrändern und Feldfläche (sog. "spillover") beeinflussen ist immer noch unklar. Wir untersuchten den spillover von zwei unterschiedlichen Gruppen von natürlichen Feinden: Raupenfliegen (Diptera: Tachinidae) und aphidivore Schwebfliegen (Diptera: Syrphidae). Zum Vergleich betrachteten wir auch die nicht-aphidivoren Schwebfliegen. Wir untersuchten den spillover zwischen zwei Arten von Feldrändern (Grasrand und Hecke mit Grasrand) und den angrenzenden Maisfeldern, die in Landschaften mit unterschiedlichen Anteilen von Ackerflächen lagen. Der spillover der natürlichen Feinde wurde vom Feldrandtyp beeinflusst, aber die beiden Gruppen reagierten unterschiedlich. Der spillover der Raupenfliegen war vom Grasrand größer als von der Hecke, was nahelegt, dass der spillover bei dieser Gruppe eher mit dem geringen Kontrast zwischen der Vegetationsstruktur von Rand und Feldfrucht zusammenhängt. Dagegen war die Abundanz der aphidivoren Schwebfliegen zur Feldmitte hin erhöht, unabhängig vom Typ des Feldrands. Der spillover der nicht-aphidivoren Schwebfliegen wurde nicht durch den Typ des Feldrandes beeinflusst. Wir fanden nur einen Einfluss der Landschaft, da ihr Artenreichtum und ihre Abundanz in Landschaften mit geringem Ackerflächenanteil höher waren. Maßnahmen zur Schaffung und Pflege von Feldrändern müssen den lokalen Unterschied zwischen Feldrändern und Feldfrüchten in Bezug auf die Biologie der verschiedenen Taxa berücksichtigen. © 2015 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.

AB  - Inclusion of perennial vegetation filter strips (PFSs) in the toeslope of annual cropland watersheds can decrease NO3--N losses to ground and surface waters. Although PFSs are similar to riparian buffers, the processes responsible for NO3--N removal from PFSs are not well understood. Our objectives were to (i) determine the importance of denitrification as a sink for NO3--N loss from PFSs and (ii) evaluate how PFSs alter the biophysical processes that affect the relative importance of N2O and N-2 emissions. To address our objectives, we used a coupled field laboratory approach with experimental watersheds that included the following treatments: (i) PFSs covering the bottom 10% of the watershed and an annual corn-soybean crop rotation covering the remaining upslope 90% (PFS); (ii) 100% corn-soybean rotation (CORN); and (iii) 19-yr-old 100% restored native grassland (RNG). In situ N2O flux rates and laboratory N2O/(N-2 + N2O) ratios were highest in CORN watersheds followed by PFS and RNG watersheds. In contrast, potentially mineralizable C and denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) were highest in PFS and RNG watersheds and lowest in CORN watersheds. Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between N2O/(N-2 + N2O) ratio and DEA. In the laboratory, N-2 fluxes were highest in PFS followed by RNG and CORN. These results indicate that PFS watersheds support greater total denitrification while emitting less N2O than croplands. Greater potentially mineralizable C in PFS and RNG suggest C availability is an important factor affecting more complete denitrification. These results suggest PFSs function similar to riparian buffers and have potential to reduce NO3--N losses from annual croplands by denitrification to N-2.

AB  - Caragana shelterbelts are a common feature of farms in the Northern Great Plains of North America. We investigated if nitrogen (N) from this leguminous shrub contributed to the N nutrition of triticale and oat forage crops growing adjacent to the shelterbelt row. Nitrogen transfer was measured using 15N isotope dilution at distances of 2 m, 4 m, 6 m, 15 m and 20 m from the shelterbelt. At 2 m caragana negatively impacted the growth of triticale and oat. At 4 m from the shelterbelt productivity was maximum for both forage crops and corresponded to the highest amount of N originating from caragana. The amount of N transferred from caragana decreased linearly with distance away from the shelterbelt, but even at 20 m from the shelterbelt row measureable amounts of N originating from caragana were detectable in the forage biomass. At 4 m from the shelterbelt approximately 40% of the N in both oat and triticale was from caragana, and at 20 m from the shelterbelt approximately 20% of the N in oat and 8% of the N in triticale was from caragana. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - Insects killed by entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) represent a resource with which soil arthropods can interact. These interactions can be positive for EPN (e.g., arthropods serve as parasitic or phoretic hosts) or negative (e.g., EPN serve as prey). Plant diversity and soil disturbance may influence these interactions. We investigated the effects of maize and flower strip habitats on microarthropod abundance and community composition in soil surrounding greater wax moth larvae, Galleria mellonella, infected with the EPN Steinernema carpocapsae (Sc). In the first year of the experiment (2005), we compared microarthropod communities responding to burial of Sc-killed insects with a control (no soil disturbance). In 2006, we added two control treatments: burial of freezer-killed insects and sham burial. Soil samples (including G. mellonella) were collected 2 and 20 clays (2005) or 2 and 12 clays (2006) after application. In 2005, arthropod abundance and community composition were similar between maize and flower strip habitats. In 2006, we detected more arthropods in the maize than the flower strips. In both years, community composition differed between treatments providing resources (Sc-killed and freezer-killed insects) and those without (sham burial and no disturbance), with the greatest difference on the final sampling date. Soil surrounding Sc-killed and freezer-killed insects contained more dipterans, acarid mites, staphylinid beetles, onychiurid and entomobryid collembolans, and immature and male mesostigmatid mites than soil at sham burial and no disturbance sites. Most of these taxa are capable of nematophagy: however. EPN relative abundance was not associated with arthropod community composition. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract: The entrapment of eroded soil organic carbon (SOC) in grass filters could affect watershed C export, but the magnitude of the process is rarely quantified. In order to assess the retention of eroded C in these settings, SOC stock was measured in grass buffers receiving runoff from cropped watersheds under long-term (>20 y): chisel-till (CT) corn (Zea mays, L.)-soybean [Glycine max, (L.) Merr.] rotation, moldboard plowing (MP) continuous corn (CC), and no-till (NT) CC. Adjacent reference grasslands not affected by erosion were also sampled. In the CC watersheds, the δ13C of bulk soil and soil separates was determined to identify the source of SOC in the grass filters. After accounting for differences in the number of corn crops, SOC stock in the MP watershed showed a corn-C deficit of 9.3 Mg C ha−1 compared to NT. Corn-C accounted for 2 to 16% (mean: 5.2 Mg C ha−1) of the total SOC pool in the grass filter and, assuming water erosion as the main determinant of C distribution, this corn-C gain translates into the retention of 55% of eroded C in the grass strip. Relative to the reference grasslands, SOC stock in the grass filters was up to 30 Mg C ha−1 higher, an amount deemed too large to be attributed solely to retention of eroded C (export rate: 0.05-0.08 Mg C ha−1 y−1). Periodic delivery of nutrients may have enhanced biomass production and indirectly contributed to the observed SOC accrual in grass filters. Higher extractable P and higher C:N ratios at these locations support that hypothesis. These results demonstrate the applicability of 13C isotope to trace SOC sources in buffers receiving runoff from areas supporting C4 vegetation. They also underscore the need to incorporate in-situ biomass production and burial processes in assessing the temporal evolution of SOC stocks in terrestrial deposits and the contribution of these landscape segments to watershed C budget.

AB  - Riparian buffers contribute to the mitigation of nutrient pollution in agricultural landscapes, but there is concern regarding their potential to be hot spots of greenhouse gas production. This study compared soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes in adjacent crop fields and riparian buffers (a flood-prone forest and a flood-protected grassland along an incised channel) and examined the impact of water table depth (WTD) and flood events on the variability of gas fluxes in riparian zones. Results showed significantly (P < 0.001) higher CO2 emission in riparian areas than in adjoining croplands (6.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.5 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1); mean +/- SE). Daily flux of CO2 and soil temperature were significantly related (P < 0.002), with Q 10 values ranging between 1.75 and 2.53. Significant relationships (P < 0.05) were found between CH4 daily flux and WTD. Flood events resulted in enhanced CH4 emission (up to + 44.5 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) in a swale) under warm soil conditions (> 22 degrees C), but the effect of flooding was less pronounced in early spring (emission < 1.06 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1)), probably due to low soil temperature. Although CH4 flux direction alternated at all sites, overall the croplands and the flood-affected riparian forest were CH4 sources, with annual emission averaging + 0.04 +/- 0.17 and + 0.92 +/- 1.6 kg CH4-C ha(-1), respectively. In the riparian forest, a topographic depression (< 8% of the total area) accounted for 78% of the annual CH4 emission, underscoring the significance of landscape heterogeneity on CH4 dynamics in riparian buffers. The nonflooded riparian grassland, however, was a net CH4 sink (-1.08 +/- 0.22 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1)), probably due to the presence of subsurface tile drains and a dredged/incised channel at that study site. Although these hydrological alterations may have contributed to improvement in the CH4 sink strength of the riparian grassland, this must be weighed against the water quality maintenance functions and other ecological services provided by riparian buffers.

AB  - In high-intensity agricultural landscapes, small landscape elements such as hedgerows, ditch banks, and rows of pollard trees may represent the last refuge of many plant and animal species, some of them being rare or even threatened with extinction. However, due to their small size and low habitat quality, long-term population survival cannot be ascertained and often active management is needed to maintain viable populations of species forced to survive in these small landscape elements. Population models are needed to assess the threats to species at risk and to evaluate alternative management actions. Here, we present a methodology to evaluate management interventions using spatio-temporal analyses of point patterns. We apply this method to several populations of primrose Primula vulgaris in Flanders, where it is rare and predominantly occurs along ditch banks. The effects of ditch bank clearing on the establishment success of seedlings was investigated by comparing spatial patterns of seedling recruitment, survival and mortality between populations that were grazed and populations that were severely disturbed by mechanical clearing of ditch banks followed by annual mowing. A total of 884 seedlings were mapped and monitored during 4 consecutive years (1999-2002). In all populations, plants showed significant clustering, but in cleared sites only seedlings were significantly clustered around adults. Spatial patterns of mortality varied according to the management intervention. In grazed sites, mortality was almost random, whereas in cleared sites we found clear evidence for strong negative density-dependent mortality. There was no evidence that the presence of adults affected survival of recruits in any of the sites studied. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that the analysis of spatial point patterns contributes to our understanding of the population dynamics of plant species occurring in different environments. The approach can be broadly applied to other plant species to elucidate the processes that determine the number of individuals that establish and persist into later life stages and will help conservation managers to refine management strategies intended to conserve or restore plant populations. In the case of P. vulgaris, increasing the availability of microsites is most likely to result in increased growth rates, as it results in increased recruitment and establishment of recruits. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - Many crop species suffer from a lack of genetic diversity which reduces the ability of cultivars to withstand new pests or environmental stresses. The wild relatives of crop plants are an important source of genetic variation and can be used to introduce new traits into existing crops. Identification and conservation of crop wild relatives (CWR) is, therefore, an important step to safeguard future food security. Recent efforts have identified geographical hotspots of CWR diversity in several countries but, as yet, there have been no surveys to identify the habitats and landscape features within these areas that might be most suitable for conservation efforts. Here, we use a UK-wide vegetation survey covering a range of both habitats and landscape features (e.g. fields, hedgerows, waterways and roadsides) to identify the habitats and features with the highest proportion of CWR identified as priority taxa for conservation. Priority CWR were most abundant in grassland habitats, although this was most striking in CWR related to forage and fodder crops. CWR related to food crops were most common in cropped and weedy areas, fertile grassland and lowland woodland. Within habitats, CWR occurrence was significantly associated with linear features including hedgerows, roadsides, field boundaries and field margins. Our findings indicate that CWR of conservation interest are often associated with disturbed habitats and landscape features that are not considered as priorities under site-based conservation measures. We suggest that efforts to maintain linear features in hotspots of CWR diversity would be most effective at conserving the UK's CWR resource.

AB  - Lagoon effluent is routinely applied to agricultural fields as fertilizer to utilize nutrients derived from animal manures. In humid regions, effluent is also applied to fields in order to manage the lagoon stage within acceptable levels. To minimize the risk of applied nutrients being transported to surface waters, best management practices such as vegetative buffers and controlled drainage are often recommended. This paper presents the results of a field study to evaluate the effectiveness of controlled drainage and vegetative buffers in reducing the transport of wastewater nutrients from land application fields. Swine lagoon effluent was spray irrigated to Bermudagrass fields drained by a parallel ditch system. Drainage outflow was monitored continuously for a 3 year period. Vegetative buffers reduced the average concentration of phosphorus by about 30%, but the average concentration of nitrogen was not affected. Controlled drainage resulted in higher individual event nitrogen concentrations, which were due primarily to irrigation onto fields at times when they were too wet to be effectively irrigated. In most cases, the concentration of total N in drainage was comparable to the values observed from other agricultural fields receiving inorganic fertilizer. However, the nitrogen was mainly in the ammonium form rather than nitrate, which could pose greater environmental risk to some fish and other aquatic species in surface waters. The peak concentrations were higher for the controlled drainage treatments than for conventional drainage. The loss of nitrogen in drainage water accounted for roughly 10% of the amount applied (8% on the conventional drainage treatments and 11% on the controlled drainage treatments). On two plots (one controlled, one conventional), more than 40% of the total N transport over the 3 year study period was associated with one extended flow event when wastewater was applied several times while the water table was near the surface. These poorly scheduled irrigations onto already wet fields resulted in as much N and P transport in one event as occurred during the remainder of the study when irrigation was properly scheduled onto dry fields. These observations suggest that irrigation scheduling and proper management were more important to water quality than remedial actions such as controlled drainage or vegetative buffers.

AB  - Density estimates, web cover and predatory importance of different spider families were investigated over one field season in relation to habitat manipulation by strip-management in a winter wheat field at Zollikofen near Berne, Switzerland. Spider densities and web cover were in most cases higher near the sown weed strips than they were away from them. The strips contained a significantly greater web cover for the sheet webs of Linyphiidae in May and at the end of July. Qualitative assessment of spiders' prey revealed high percentages (up to 92%) of Diptera and Aphidina (including pests). Quantitative evaluation of spider predation in the orb webs of Araneidae/Tetragnathidae and the sheet webs of Linyphiidae showed very small prey turnover rates e.g. Linyphiidae killed on average 1.5-1.7 aphids m-2 9 h daylight-1 in wheat. Theoretical estimates of diurnal prey capture in all spider webs (including Theridiidae and Agelenidae) were calculated. Comparisons with the reduction of noxious insects by other polyphagous predators suggested that in the investigated field the importance of spiders as biological control agents is rather small.

AB  - Riparian habitats play a major role in biodiversity conservation in intensive agricultural landscapes because they represent remnants of both wetland and woody habitats available for wildlife. The importance of herbaceous, shrubby and wooded riparian habitats for the conservation of biodiversity (plants, amphibians, reptiles, birds, small mammals) is well documented for the Boyer River watershed (southern Quebec, Canada). This paper examines their conservation value for these different taxonomic groups at the watershed level and the possible effects on wildlife of various landscape modification scenarios. The overall species richness and insectivorous bird abundance in the watershed would increase markedly if there were more wooded strips in the landscape mainly due to additional plant and bird species. A scenario where all three types of riparian strips would be well-represented in the watershed is most likely to be implemented. This scenario would be the most beneficial to wildlife communities because of high native species diversity within wooded strips combined with the presence of unique species associated with each of the three types of strips. Encouraging landowners to protect existing wooded riparian habitats would be the most effective and cost-beneficial method to maintain current level of habitats distribution in the landscape, and to favour the establishment of new shrubby and wooded strips in the Boyer River watershed.

AB  - Habitat structure and bird use of field margins were studied in intensive farmlands of southern Québec, Canada. The main objectives were: (1) to assess the value of field margins for conserving avian diversity in agricultural landscapes, (2) to document their potential as breeding habitats for bird species particularly those considered as nuisance for crops, and (3) to describe habitat variables that best explained bird use of field margins. Three types of field margins were distinguished: (a) natural hedgerows (n = 27) with well developed tree and shrub strata, (b) planted windbreaks (n = 17) mostly composed of coniferous trees and generally devoid of a well structured shrub stratum, and (c) herbaceous field margins (n = 17) with isolated shrubs. A total of 42 bird species were recorded. Bird use of hedgerows and windbreaks was similar, herbaceous field margins having fewer bird species and individuals than the other two types of field margin. Field margins did not contribute significantly as breeding habitats of bird species that may damage crops, but offered shelter to a broad range of species potentially useful for biological pest control. Bird use of field margins was mostly related to hedges' structural complexity and dimension. Conserving natural hedgerows, minimising mechanical and chemical control of the vegetation in field margins, and planting a mix of deciduous and coniferous species in windbreaks represent efficient conservation strategies both from a wildlife and an agronomic point of view. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Agroecosystems dominate the U.S. landscape, and conversion of natural land to crop fields is often cited as a leading threat to biodiversity. Agricultural practices designed to enhance biodiversity can provide farms with ecological services such as pollination. Insect pollinators, including bees, are widely considered to be indicators of ecosystem health as a result of their co-evolved relationships with the plants they pollinate. This study explored whether native plant hedgerows have a positive effect on pollinator presence. Bees were collected from six organically managed farms in Central California, four of which had hedgerows and two that did not. On hedgerow sites, bees were sampled at varying distances out from the hedgerows. Native bee abundance and diversity were markedly greater on hedgerow sites. Additionally, native bee presence and species richness were higher in samples collected within the hedgerow than in those collected at further distances from these native plantings.

AB  - 1. Grants for wildlife enhancement in the British Isles have supported the widespread planting of new hedges along field margins. However, much of the planted material, particularly of hawthorn Crataegus monogyna, has been obtained from the continental mainland of Europe. There is a need to assess the implications of this practice for hedge-row performance and for the conservation of indigenous genetic variation. 2. One local ecotype and eight commercial provenances (four British and four continental European) of hawthorn were planted in an experimental hedge at both an exposed upland site and a sheltered lowland site. Sections of hedge were planted with or without fencing and with or without mulching in all combinations. Growth and thorniness were assessed over 3 years, and phenology and disease over 2 years. 3. At both sites, the most locally obtained provenance had the latest bud-burst, exhibited the least severe symptoms of mildew and was the most thorny. It also showed the greatest height increment at the upland site, but was relatively slow-growing at the lowland site. 4. An imported Hungarian provenance had early bud-burst, showed a high growth rate and suffered the most severe mildew. A commercially obtained British native provenance was aberrant in its extremely early bud-burst and other attributes comparable with the Hungarian provenance, indicating the possibility of misidentification at some stage of production or supply. 5. In the absence of fencing, at the upland site hawthorn mortality was 100% compared with only 3% at the lowland site. In fenced plots there was c. 320% greater growth when mulching was used. 6. The results suggest that for greater establishment success and hence cost benefits in hedge planting, as well as for greater environmental benefits, there should be closer matching of hawthorn provenance to the planting site. The use of commercial material has demonstrated that locally provenanced material can be superior to any commercially available material, and that the current state of the commercial sector is insufficient to enforce the necessary controls over provenance of material used for hedge renovation.

AB  - Grassland field margin strips, including hedge bottoms, may support a high diversity of wild flower and grass species. This diversity is threatened by applications of fertilizer nitrogen. Organic fertilizer, in the form of farm-yard manure and rain-diluted liquid slurry which only slowly release nitrogen for plant uptake, might prove less damaging. A 5-year experiment on two contrasting sheep grazed, species-rich grassland field margin sites adjoining a mature hedgerow in mid-Wales compared three levels of fertilizer N (0, 100 and 300 kg N ha-1 year-1) with farm yard manure (FYM) and rain-diluted slurry containing an average annual equivalent of 30-42 kg N ha-1 and 27-72 kg N ha-1 respectively. The aim was 10 assess the impact of treatments on the plant communities of the hedge bottom and field margin strip ecosystems, and to establish whether the species diversity contained within the strips could be encouraged without significantly undermining the quantity and quality of the herbage. By the end of the experiment, the forb component of both ecosystems had been drastically reduced by the high N treatment, to less than half of their original level. The organic treatments on the other hand, particularly FYM showed signs of developing species-rich communities, while at the same time providing a relatively high yielding and nutrient-rich field margin sward of high mineral content. The implications of FYM deposition, particularly in terms of nature conservation considerations are highlighted.

AB  - The overall goal of my research was to assess the potential for integrating bird conservation on farmlands while enhancing production goals through augmentation of insect pest control. Working on selected conventional and organic farms in North-central Florida my study objectives were to (1) assess habitat characteristics on and adjacent to farms influencing avian species diversity and insect-foraging activity, and to identify 'functional insectivores' on these farms; (2) determine the effectiveness of sunflower intercrops as refugia for, both, insectivorous birds and beneficial insects in cropped fields, and as tools to enhance insect-foraging by birds in cropped areas; (3) test the hypothesis that insectivorous birds can potentially augment pest control programs involving hymenopteran parasitoid predators, via active preferences for unparasitized over parasitized prey. Using a combination of bird surveys and focal foraging observations over two years, I determined that bird diversity in cropped and non-cropped habitats on farms varied in the following ways; (a) vegetation type in field borders significantly influenced species richness per census point (F 5,30 = 3.5, P = 0.013) and in field borders (F5,30 = 3.8, P = 0.009); (b) mixed crops generated significantly greater bird densities per point (F1,30 = 7.4, P = 0.011) and in cropped fields (F1,30 = 8.2, P = 0.008) and (c) foraging activity and abundance of functional insectivores were greatest in mixed crops (F1,29 = 4.2, P = 0.051). In a replicated, controlled field experiment I determined that intercropping rows of sunflowers significantly increased densities of birds (F = 43.33, p < 0.001), attracted greater numbers (F = 57.51, p < 0.001), and increased foraging time by individual insectivores in crops (F = 50.18, p < 0.001). Visual observations and stomach samples confirmed that birds consumed economically important pest insects. In feeding trials blackbirds exhibited no preference between parasitized and nonparasitized lepidopteran larvae of similar body size (Z = -7.44, p = 0.46) but a significant preference for larger non-parasitized prey (Z = -3.93, p < 0.001). My study suggests that managing farmland habitat can enhance wild bird populations and the potential that they can augment pest control programs in modern agricultural operations.

AB  - We studied the potential for native birds to control insect pests on farms. We assessed habitat factors correlated with diversity, distribution, and insect-foraging activity of native birds on farms in north-central Florida and then characterized common bird species that consumed insect biomass in crops as "functional insectivores" (birds most likely to contribute to pest control). Analyses of point-count survey data and foraging observations collected over 2 years on paired organic and conventional farm sites indicated that (1) farms supported most (82-96%) land birds known to breed in the region; (2) bird species richness and abundance varied significantly with matrix habitat and field border type (but not with year or farm management type); (3) the highest bird abundances were associated with mixed crop plantings, field borders, and adjacent matrix composed of forest and hedge; and (4) abundances of 10 species identified as functional insectivores were primarily influenced by crop type (mixed crops attracted significantly more insect foragers into fields than monocrops). We documented birds eating pest insects in crops and did not observe substantive crop damage by birds during growing-season observations. We advocate use of the term functional insectivore to emphasize the potential positive role of avian insectivory on farms during the growing season.

Evaluamos factores del hábitat correlacionados con la diversidad, distribución y actividad de forrajeo de insectos de aves nativas en tierras agrícolas del norte-centro de Florida y posteriormente caracterizamos como "insectívoros funcionales" (aves que más probablemente contribuyen al control de plagas) a las especies comunes de aves que consumían biomasa de insectos en los cultivos. El análisis de datos de conteos por puntos y de observaciones de forrajeo recolectados a lo largo de 2 años en ranchos orgánicos y convencionales pareados indicó que (1) los ranchos sostenían a la mayoría (82%-96%) de las especies de aves terrestres residentes conocidas en la región; (2) la riqueza y abundancia de especies de aves variaron significativamente con el tipo de matriz de hábitat y borde (pero no con el año o tipo de manejo del rancho); (3) las mayores abundancias de aves se asociaron con cultivos mixtos, bordes, y matriz adyacente compuesta de bosque y setos; y (4) la abundancia de las 10 especies consideradas insectívoros funcionales fue influida por el tipo de cultivo principalmente (los cultivos mixtos significativamente atrajeron a mas insectívoros que los monocultivos). Documentamos a aves alimentándose de insectos plaga en los cultivos y no observamos daño sustancial de las aves en los cultivos. Recomendamos el uso del término insectívoro funcional para enfatizar el papel positivo potencial de la insectivoría de aves en tierras agrícolas durante el período de crecimiento.

AB  - We conducted a 13-year study to determine bird species richness and abundance in field edges maintained in conservation buffers and mowed field edges on two agricultural experiment stations in Mississippi. Both experiment stations were intensively managed for agricultural row crop and dairy production with field edges managed with frequent mowing and herbicide application. Habitat reclamation and management on 41 ha of field edges was initiated on each farm in 1988 and included selective spraying herbicides to control agronomic grasses, cessation of annual mowing, protection from livestock access, and planting legumes and shrubs. We surveyed birds from 1 May through 15 June on permanently established, fixed-width transects in three conservation buffer and three mowed field edges adjacent to row crops on each experimental farm from 1989 through 2001. We detected 25 bird species on mowed field edges and 51 species on edges maintained in conservation buffers on both farms. Mean species richness and bird abundance were higher (P < 0.05) on conservation buffers than on mowed field edges on both farms. We attributed higher bird species richness and abundance in conservation buffers to a more diverse habitat structure and increased food plant availability created by native plant succession and shrub plantings. These results support the concept that creation and maintenance of conservation buffers in field edges along row crops can increase bird species richness and abundance on agricultural lands.

AB  - Hedgerows constitute a major wildlife habitat in many areas of Britain. The theory of island biogeography, and in particular the equilibrium model, is often invoked to explain the characteristics of communities inhabiting habitat patches. The particularly interesting feature about hedgerows is that they are both a linear, and often an interconnecting patch-type. Landscape ecology addresses the spatial and temporal relationship between patch and matrix habitats and may, therefore, contribute to an understanding of species distributions in hedgerows. Hedgerows on arable land in North Yorkshire and Oxfordshire were studied to assess which factors influence community characteristics and to determine the relevance of island biogeographic and landscape ecological concepts. Three contrasting wildlife groups were studied. First, a plant study addressed the extent to which habitat area can be used to predict species richness. Only in Oxfordshire did a significant species-area effect exist. Hedgerow isolation was also investigated by using indices of connectivity and with the formulation of a hedgerow accessibility index that attempted to measure the degree of physical connectance of a hedge to the surrounding hedgerow network. These indices were only of minor interpretive value and both their conceptual limitations and the difference between functional and physical habitat connectance is recognised. Second, a small mammal study investigated the habitat preference of species and the movements of individuals in and around hedgerows that were either isolated or well connected to others. Species-specific patterns in field/hedgerow preference and movement behaviour were observed. There appeared to be no reliance on hedgerow connections for inter-hedge movement although the presence of nearby roads and verges may have modified movement patterns. Third, a study of millipedes and woodlice addressed both the effect of hedgerow connections and the influence of soil properties on species distributions. Soil pH appeared to be a major determinant of community composition. Hedgerow configuration history and the possibility of `relic' communities are discussed. It is considered that the role of hedgerows as habitats and corridors will depend upon the autecology of the species considered, the quality of the hedgerow habitat and the nature of both the adjacent fields and their surrounding hedgerow network. Island biogeographic concepts are unable to model adequately community characteristics in hedgerows both because of their often narrow and interconnecting nature and because of the temporarily variable land matrix in which they are set. Landscape ecology and metapopulation dynamics may be more profitable conceptual frameworks within which to address the community characteristics of hedgerows.

AB  - Pollinator populations have suffered severe declines in many industrialised countries due to reduced floral and nesting resources, brought on by agricultural intensification. One potential method of mitigating these effects is creating flower strips. Most previous studies have shown higher pollinator abundances in flower strips, but none have been able to demonstrate increased pollinator abundances at larger spatial scales, in the surrounding agricultural landscapes. We assessed local and landscape-wide effects of flower strips on pollinator abundances, using 18 carefully selected study landscapes in southern Sweden, distributed along independent gradients of landscape heterogeneity and farming intensity. We found that flower strips were more attractive than field borders in general to bumblebees, whereas hoverflies were only attracted to flower strips from nearby field borders. Solitary bees declined with increasing distance from flower strips, but only in complex landscapes. As one of the first studies investigating effects of flower strips on pollinators across the wider landscape, we found increased abundance of bumblebees, but not solitary bees, in field borders outside the flower strips in floristically enhanced landscapes as compared with control landscapes. However, we found that higher quality and/or larger total area of flower strips within a farm was important for both bumblebees and solitary bees. Hoverfly abundance was enhanced on farms with flower strips in simple landscapes. Our results demonstrate that flower strips with rewarding plants do not only attract pollinators locally, but in addition have the potential to increase pollinator abundances across entire landscapes, and particularly in landscapes dominated by farmland.

AB  - Two artificially drained, arable sub-catchments with buffer strips of 1 m and 20 m width respectively were investigated to quantify nutrient retention in vegetated buffer strips. The quality of ditch and tile-drainage water was monitored over two hydrological winter half-years. Higher nitrate concentrations (c(NO3-) = 101 mg l(-1) vers. c(NO3-) = 59 mg l(-1)) and seasonal nitrate loads (F-s = 199 kg ha(-1) vers. F-s = 91 kg ha(-1)) were detected in the sub-catchment with a narrow buffer strip. However, differences depended on flow intensity and nitrate concentrations in tile-drainage water and only to a lesser extent on buffer strip width. A minor retention effect of the buffer strips was observed at base flow. In case of artificially drained agricultural land, buffer strips are of minor importance for the nitrate retention via the groundwater path.

AB  - Spiders are important components of agricultural ecosystems as far as they affect markedly the abundance of crop pests. The objective of the study was to determine whether the planting of forested strips (shelterbelts) in agricultural area enhances the biomass of spiders active on soil surface of cereal fields and if the exchange of individuals between these habitats depends on the age of trees. The investigations were carried on in 2000 and repeated in 2003/2004 along transects across young shelterbelts (2-11 years old) - ecotones - fields. In the second period the 150 years old forest strip was included into the study. So altogether in both periods the study was performed in the strip-managed area in forested strips 2, 6, 7, 11, and 150 years old, adjacent cereal fields and in the control field located in a deforested area. The intensity of patrolling (number of individuals captured per trap per day) the soil surface by spiders was investigated using pitfall traps forming lines parallel to the shelterbelt. The results of both investigation periods show, that forested strips increased the biomass of patrolling spiders (BP - biomass of spiders per trap per day) in the fields. It was higher in the fields located in the strip-managed area than in the deforested area by ca 70%. The BP decreased gradually with the increasing distance from the strips. Differences between the strip and the field at a distance of 50m were significant (two-way ANOVA, post hoc Tukey test). The reason for the higher BP in the fields adjacent to forested strips was mainly the dispersal of larger spiders from strips to adjacent fields. Dispersal is high between the very young strip and the field and low between the oldest strip and the field. The group of forest-inhabiting species accounted for 0.3-0.5% of the total number of spiders in the field located in deforested area. In the fields adjacent to young shelterbelts this proportion increases with the strips age from 1 to 6%. But in the field bordering the oldest forest strip it is low again and accounted for 1.4%. In this field the proportion of agrobionts is almost as high (94%) as in the field located in deforested area (98%). Similarly the species diversity was very low there. The mean individual body mass of spiders from all the fields located in the strip-managed area was 2.7 times higher than in the control field (P <0.001). It can be concluded, that in the old forest strips the number of specific species, which don't disperse to surroundings, increases. This conclusion may be important for, landscape management.

AB  - The impact of wooded shelterbelts on the patrolling intensity (number of patrolling individuals per trap, per day (NP) - activity density) of spiders and ground beetles was investigated by using pitfall traps placed in parallel rows in shelterbelt centers, along margins of wood and field, and in open wheat fields at a distance of 10 and 50 m from trees. In the shelterbelt - managed areas the biomass of patrolling (BP) arthropods (ground beetles and spiders) was lower inside the fields (F10, F50) than at the field margins and in the shelterbelts. The BP and individual weight increased with the age of strips. However, in the control field with no wood in the vicinity, the BP of carabid beetles was as high as inside the shelterbelts. The highest similarity between the shelterbelts and the field (BP, Morisita's similarity index, diversity index H', individual weight) was found in the field adjoining the youngest (aged 2 years) shelterbelt. It is concluded that similarity between permanent and cultivated ecosystems is important for successful exchange of individuals between them. In the field adjacent to young shelterbelt and in the field with no woods in the vicinity the aeronautic, agrobiont species prevail. In the fields adjacent to older shelterbelts colonization by large body-size species, characteristic for permanent ecosystems was found.

AB  - The studies on the role of recently established shelterbelts as refuges available for wintering insects were carried out in the years 1994-2002. Soil and litter samples were taken (the material being sorted manually) from five young (up to 7 years old) and two older midfield shelterbelts, from the ecotone zones and from the adjacent croplands. A high numbers (250-400 ind. m -2) of insects, which biomass varied between 950 and 2300 mg dry wt. m-2, were found to overwinter in young (4-7 years old) shelterbelts. The insects formed communities (dominated by Coleoptera) represented by over 50 families. Effects of the shelterbelt's age, the presence or absence of litter, specific composition of trees and the location of sampling plots within the shelterbelt on wintering insects are discussed.

AB  - At suburb of Saransk, there has been discovered the excess of relatively admissible concentration for Fe and Cr at the protective zone of the forest shelter belt, for Zn in soil of the forest shelter belt and for Co inside the forest shelter belt and 10m from that. Pb pollution is marked in soil of the forest shelter belt, what proves its ability to keep technogenic waste, particularly that element. The concentration of heavy metals in soil away from the forest shelter belt in lee side propagates to 30-50 m and for Ni - up to 100 m.

AB  - A significant portion of the NO3 from agricultural fields that contaminates surface waters in the Midwest Corn Belt is transported to streams or rivers by subsurface drainage systems or "tiles." Previous research has shown that N fertilizer management alone is not sufficient for reducing NO3 concentrations in subsurface drainage to acceptable levels; therefore, additional approaches need to be devised. We compared two cropping system modifications for NO3 concentration and load in subsurface drainage water for a no-till corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) management system. In one treatment, eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides L.) was grown in permanent 3.05-m-wide strips above the tiles. For the second treatment, a rye (Secale cereale L.) winter cover crop was seeded over the entire plot area each year near harvest and chemically killed before planting the following spring. Twelve 30.5x42.7-m subsurface-drained field plots were established in 1999 with an automated system for measuring tile flow and collecting flow-weighted samples. Both treatments and a control were initiated in 2000 and replicated four times. Full establishment of both treatments did not occur until fall 2001 because of dry conditions. Treatment comparisons were conducted from 2002 through 2005. The rye cover crop treatment significantly reduced subsurface drainage water flow-weighted NO3 concentrations and NO3 loads in all 4 yr. The rye cover crop treatment did not significantly reduce cumulative annual drainage. Averaged over 4 yr, the rye cover crop reduced flow-weighted NO3 concentrations by 59% and loads by 61%. The gamagrass strips did not significantly reduce cumulative drainage, the average annual flow-weighted NO3 concentrations, or cumulative NO3 loads averaged over the 4 yr. Rye winter cover crops grown after corn and soybean have the potential to reduce the NO3 concentrations and loads delivered to surface waters by subsurface drainage systems.

AB  - The paper presents a review of research on functioning of agricultural landscape, mainly on protection of ecosystem services, carried out by the Institute for Agricultural and Forest Environment, Polish Academy of Sciences in Turew in the period of 1970-2009. The paper concentrates on water balance and water pollution control and the protection of biodiversity in an agricultural landscape. The results of the researches show that the best way for maintenance ecosystem services is development of landscape complexity. Introduction of non-productive elements like shelterbelts, strips of meadows, small ponds allows for improvement of water balance, reduction of groundwater pollution even by 90% and enhancement of biodiversity.

AB  - Denitrification is recognized as the major mechanism for reducing nitrate (NO3- ) in riparian buffers and thus diminishing non-point source pollution (NPS) of surface water bodies subject to high N loads. However, increasing denitrification rates in riparian buffers may be trading the problem of NPS pollution of surface waters for atmospheric deterioration and increased global warming potential because denitrification produces nitrous oxide (N 2 O), a greenhouse gas also involved in stratospheric ozone depletion. Also N2 O produced in the denitrification process can be dissolved in groundwater and is eventually emitted into the air when groundwater flows into a stream or a river. Riparian buffers restored from cultivated crop fields may have significant capacities as sinks or sources of CH 4 . It therefore is important to quantify the fluxes of N2 O, CH4 and dissolved N2 O, identify the source of N 2 O from different kinds of riparian buffer systems and evaluate the significance of N2 O and CH4 sources. We measured N inputs, weather conditions and N2 O and CH4 fluxes from soils in forested riparian buffers, warm-season and cool-season grass filters, and a crop field located in the Bear Creek watershed in central Iowa. We measured concentrations of NO3- , dissolved N2 O, and other chemical properties in groundwater under a multi-species riparian buffer, a cool-season grass filter, and the adjacent crop field. The forest buffer and grass filter soils had significantly lower bulk density; and higher pH, total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), and ammonium (NH 4 + ) than those in the crop field. Nitrous oxide emissions from soils in all riparian buffers (1.8-4.5 kg N2 O-N ha-1 ) were significantly less than those in the crop fields (7.2-16.8 kg N 2 O-N ha-1 ), but no differences among different kinds of riparian buffers were observed. Our results indicate that the emission factor (ratio of N2 O emission to N inputs) of soils in riparian buffers was smaller than the crop fields. While N2 O peak emissions followed by rewetting dry soils and thawing frozen soils significantly contributed to annual N2 O emissions from soils in the crop fields, soils in the riparian buffers were less sensitive to such events. Soil incubation with inhibitors indicated that the main sources of N2 O might be nitrifier denitrification and denitrification in the crop field soil and nitrifier denitrification in the riparian buffer soils. The ratio of N2 O to N2 in riparian buffer soil (0.88-6.8) was less than that found in crop field soil (16.5). These results suggest that N2 O emissions from soils in all riparian buffers were significantly less than those in the crop field. In both a multi-species riparian buffer and a cool-season grass filter, NO 3- concentrations in groundwater were significantly decreased in comparison to those in the crop field, by 48-59%. However, dissolved N 2 O concentrations in groundwater did not differ among locations (6-14 μg L-1 ). These results indicate that the riparian buffers decreased NO3- concentrations in near-surface groundwater, without increasing N2 O losses. Methane fluxes in crop field soil were not observed to be significantly different from those in the forest buffer and grass filter soils, and no significant difference in CH4 flux was found between the forest buffer and grass filter soils. Annual CH 4 flux was -0.80 kg C ha-1 yr-1 , -0.46 kg C ha-1 yr-1 , and 0.04 kg C ha-1 yr-1 in the crop field, forest buffers and grass filters, respectively. The annual CH4 flux in forest buffers and grass filters were not significantly different from zero and these three amounts were not significantly different from one another. These results suggest that (1) N2 O emissions from soils in all riparian buffers were significantly less than those in the crop field, (2) the riparian buffers decreased NO3 - concentrations in near-surface groundwater, without increasing N 2 O losses, and (3) CH4 flux in the crop field, forest buffers and grass filters were not different and CH4 flux was not changed in the forest buffers a d grass filters soils, despite that soil properties have changed significantly since the planting of the forest buffers and the grass filters.

AB  - Denitrification is recognized as the major mechanism for reducing nitrate (NO3- ) in riparian buffers and thus diminishing non-point source pollution (NPS) of surface water bodies subject to high N loads. However, increasing denitrification rates in riparian buffers may be trading the problem of NPS pollution of surface waters for atmospheric deterioration and increased global warming potential because denitrification produces nitrous oxide (N 2 O), a greenhouse gas also involved in stratospheric ozone depletion. Also N2 O produced in the denitrification process can be dissolved in groundwater and is eventually emitted into the air when groundwater flows into a stream or a river. Riparian buffers restored from cultivated crop fields may have significant capacities as sinks or sources of CH 4 . It therefore is important to quantify the fluxes of N2 O, CH4 and dissolved N2 O, identify the source of N 2 O from different kinds of riparian buffer systems and evaluate the significance of N2 O and CH4 sources. We measured N inputs, weather conditions and N2 O and CH4 fluxes from soils in forested riparian buffers, warm-season and cool-season grass filters, and a crop field located in the Bear Creek watershed in central Iowa. We measured concentrations of NO3- , dissolved N2 O, and other chemical properties in groundwater under a multi-species riparian buffer, a cool-season grass filter, and the adjacent crop field. The forest buffer and grass filter soils had significantly lower bulk density; and higher pH, total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), and ammonium (NH 4 + ) than those in the crop field. Nitrous oxide emissions from soils in all riparian buffers (1.8-4.5 kg N2 O-N ha-1 ) were significantly less than those in the crop fields (7.2-16.8 kg N 2 O-N ha-1 ), but no differences among different kinds of riparian buffers were observed. Our results indicate that the emission factor (ratio of N2 O emission to N inputs) of soils in riparian buffers was smaller than the crop fields. While N2 O peak emissions followed by rewetting dry soils and thawing frozen soils significantly contributed to annual N2 O emissions from soils in the crop fields, soils in the riparian buffers were less sensitive to such events. Soil incubation with inhibitors indicated that the main sources of N2 O might be nitrifier denitrification and denitrification in the crop field soil and nitrifier denitrification in the riparian buffer soils. The ratio of N2 O to N2 in riparian buffer soil (0.88-6.8) was less than that found in crop field soil (16.5). These results suggest that N2 O emissions from soils in all riparian buffers were significantly less than those in the crop field. In both a multi-species riparian buffer and a cool-season grass filter, NO 3- concentrations in groundwater were significantly decreased in comparison to those in the crop field, by 48-59%. However, dissolved N 2 O concentrations in groundwater did not differ among locations (6-14 μg L-1 ). These results indicate that the riparian buffers decreased NO3- concentrations in near-surface groundwater, without increasing N2 O losses. Methane fluxes in crop field soil were not observed to be significantly different from those in the forest buffer and grass filter soils, and no significant difference in CH4 flux was found between the forest buffer and grass filter soils.

AB  - While water quality functions of conservation buffers established adjacent to cropped Fields have been widely documented, the relative contribution of these re-established perennial plant systems to greenhouse gases has not been completely documented. In the case of methane (CH4), these systems have the potential to serve as sinks of CH4 or may provide favorable conditions for CH4 production. This study quantifies CH4 flux from soils of riparian buffer systems comprised of three vegetation types and compares these fluxes with those of adjacent crop fields. We measured soil properties and diel and seasonal variations of CH4 flux in 7 to 17 yr-old re-established riparian forest buffers, warm-season and cool-season grass filters, and an adjacent crop field located in the Bear Creek watershed in central Iowa. Forest buffer and grass filter soils had significantly lower bulk density (P < 0.01); and higher pH (P < 0.01), total carbon (TC) (P < 0.01), and total nitrogen (TN) (P < 0.01) than crop field soils. There was no significant relationship between CH4 flux mid soil moisture or soil temperature among sites within the range of conditions observed. Cumulative CH4 flux was -0.80 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the cropped field, -0.416 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1) within the forest buffers, and 0.04 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1) within grass filters, but difference among vegetation covers was not significant. Results Suggest that CH4 flux was not changed after establishment of perennial vegetation on cropped soils, despite significant changes in soil properties.

AB  - Biotic diversity in rural areas is one of the key paints of sustainable agriculture and rural development. Biotic diversity and species restoration are closely connected with habitats and thus plant cover diversity. Hungarian agriculture is in a state of transition towards market oriented production and development. Changes in property rights, farm size, land use and the greater importance of environmental issues demand new approaches for plant protection and habitat evaluation. In our study some examples will be given showing the importance both of fields and field margins and about their contribution to plant protection and nature production. Plant species and predators (carabids, spiders) were studied in winter wheat fields and in the field margins. Evidence was found of the importance of the field margin for the number and composition of plant species. Parallel to this, carabids and spiders (as significant predators) were studied. For both carabids and spiders, species number and diversity were significantly higher in field margins compared with fields. The species distribution of carabids among these two different habitats, however, indicates that some species are typical 'field species'. Thus, proper management of both habitats is necessary so that they may contribute to biotic diversity, A possible evaluation of the contribution of habitats to native flora and fauna is discussed.

AB  - In British Columbia, the Canada-British Columbia Environmental Farm Plan Beneficial Management Practices Program (BMP Program) encourages the adoption of agrienvironmental practices on farms. The BMP Program is a voluntary and confidential program, which is jointly funded by the BC Ministry of Agriculture and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Since 2005 the BMP Program has provided funding to farmers to adopt agri-environmental Beneficial Management Practices (BMPs) and during this time no evaluation of the program has occurred resulting in a lack of program feedback to program directors. The specific objectives for this project were to (1) develop a methodology to conduct a social, economic and environmental outcome evaluation of BMPs adopted on BC farms; (2) evaluate the social, economic and environmental outcomes of four BMPs and; (3) make policy recommendations to the Ministry of Agriculture to allow for adaptive management of the BMP Program using the evaluation methodology. The four BMPs evaluated for this study included Alternative Watering Systems to Manage Livestock, Riparian Buffer Establishment, Irrigation Management, and Wildlife Damage Prevention. The evaluation was undertaken for four BMPs with partially overlapping surveys, which were administered with a sample of BMP adopters in the fall of 2011 with in-person interviews as well as with mail surveys. The surveys collected both baseline and social, economic and environmental BMP outcome data. Results show that environmental outcomes are positive but in some cases depend on on-going maintenance and upkeep of certain BMPs. Generally adopters of the Riparian BMPs are motivated by stewardship and environmental factors whereas adopters of the Irrigation Management and Wildlife Damage Prevention BMPs are motivated by on-farm benefits offered by the BMPs. The largest barrier to adoption for all BMPs appears to be cost; however, barriers are overall lower for both the Irrigation Management and Wildlife Damage Prevention BMPs , which is reflected in the adoption levels to date. Results of the study highlight both the outcomes of the BMP to individual farm operations, and the overall impact of the BMP Program to society and also provides critical feedback to program directors.

AB  - Agri-environment schemes are an increasingly important tool for the maintenance and restoration of farmland biodiversity in Europe but their ecological effects are poorly known. Scheme design is partly based on non-ecological considerations and poses important restrictions on evaluation studies. We describe a robust approach to evaluate agri-environment schemes and use it to evaluate the biodiversity effects of agri-environment schemes in five European countries. We compared species density of vascular plants, birds, bees, grasshoppers and crickets, and spiders on 202 paired fields, one with an agri-environment scheme, the other conventionally managed. In all countries, agri-environment schemes had marginal to moderately positive effects on biodiversity. However, uncommon species benefited in only two of five countries and species listed in Red Data Books rarely benefited from agri-environment schemes. Scheme objectives may need to differentiate between biodiversity of common species that can be enhanced with relatively simple modifications in farming practices and diversity or abundance of endangered species which require more elaborate conservation measures.

AB  - In France, the Netherlands and the UK, arable field boundaries were extended with four metres of crop edge. Plots with perennial, herbaceous vegetation were established by natural regeneration or by sowing grass, both annually cut. Vegetation development was monitored in the first three years after establishment in the original boundary and in the new boundary strip. Species composition, species-richness and biomass production in the new strip were related to those in the original boundary to examine the potential of predicting vegetation development in extended field boundaries from the vegetation composition of the original boundary. Within three years species-richness, biomass production and monocot:dicot ratio in both the grass and regeneration plots converged to the levels of the original boundary in all three countries. Species composition in the new strip was not closely related to the original boundary, however, since only 20-50% of the species encountered in the original boundary at the onset of the experiment had managed to colonise the new boundary strip in the final year. The low similarity was mainly due to low establishment rates of annual and woodland species in the new strip while mobile, perennial grassland species were generally very successful. Sowing grass, which may be preferable with respect to weed control, had adverse effects on species-richness. These relationships, which were found to apply in a broad geographical area and in different boundary types, may aid efforts to restore botanical diversity in arable field boundaries.

AB  - 1. In recent decades the botanical diversity of arable field boundaries has declined drastically. To determine the most important factors related to the species composition of arable field boundaries, the vegetation composition of 105 herbaceous boundaries, 1-m wide, in the central and eastern Netherlands was surveyed. Biomass samples of the boundary were taken at 0-33, 34-66 and 67-100 cm from the adjacent arable field. 2. Farmers were interviewed with respect to boundary management and land use on the adjacent arable field. The two data sets containing the botanical data and the environmental variables were linked and analysed by multivariate analysis and analysis of variance. 3. The nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to the crop were closely correlated to another environmental variable, crop rotation. Crop rotations dominated by maize cultivation received significantly higher nutrient inputs than the other rotations. 4. Nitrogen, phosphorus and crop rotation were strongly correlated with the composition of the boundary vegetation. Species richness of the boundary vegetation was negatively related to nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to the crop, while total boundary biomass was negatively related to nitrogen inputs only. Furthermore, there was a significant relationship between the partitioning of the boundary vegetation between different functional groups and both nitrogen inputs and crop rotation on the adjacent arable field. No significant relationships were found between the vegetation composition and either herbicide use in the boundary or boundary management. This may have been due to the descriptive approach of the study: little variation in boundary management as well as herbicide use in the boundary was observed in the study area. 5. The boundary vegetation was characterized by a peak in biomass production in the zone near the arable field. In this zone the perennial arable weed Elymus repens, as well as annual dicot species, were significantly more abundant, while perennial dicots and monocots were significantly less abundant compared with the zones further from the arable field. 6. Efforts to protect field boundary vegetation need to focus on a reduction or cessation of fertilizer applications in the outer metre(s) of crops that require high nutrient inputs. The determination of the exact nature of the relationship between the vegetation composition of arable field boundaries and the intuitively important management and herbicide use in the boundary requires an experimental approach.

AB  - Inspired by international escalation in agricultural sustainability debates, we explored the promise of landscape-scale conservation buffers to mitigate environmental damage, improve ecological function, and enhance scenic quality. Although the ecological benefits of buffer vegetation are well established by plot- and field-scale research, buffer adoption by farmers is limited. Landscape-scale approaches can address several obstacles by simultaneously considering ecological impact, economic efficiency, and aesthetic quality and preference in buffer placement and design. Within four watersheds of Washington's Palouse farming region, we examined relationships between ecological and aesthetic responses to the existing landscape structure plus three alternative scenarios, differentiated by successive increases in woody buffers. Methodology combined GIS analysis, digital image simulation, soil erosion modeling and mapping, and a landscape preference survey. Landscape ecological function, measured by erosion and deposition rates, improved as buffer elements were added into each successive scenario. Magnitude of improvements varied among scenarios and among watersheds, revealing opportunities for targeting buffers to maximize ecological benefits and economic efficiency. Concurrently, aesthetic preference, measured as scenic quality ratings, increased significantly (p < 0.05) from the existing landscape through the second successive scenario of improved ecological function. No preference difference was found between the second and third scenarios. Results expand current understanding of multifunctional relationships in agricultural landscapes and encourage future research on whether linking ecological and aesthetic quality in buffer design might favorably influence adoption. Results also suggest that, within certain landscape contexts, visually perceivable attributes can provide a relative and coincident indication of ecological function, aesthetic quality, and agricultural sustainability.

AB  - Runoff studies with simulated rainfall at an intensity of 14 mm/h were carried out on a mesoplot of 1200 m-2 planted with triticale. The herbicides dichlorprop-p, isoproturon, and bifenox were applied to the plots, which had a soil water content of about 30% (kg/kg). Runoff in the compressed tractor lanes occurred rapidly, whereas a total runoff over the whole plot started at a total rainfall of 14.0 mm and the initial concentrations of dichlorprop-p and isoproturon were 1400 mu-g/l. In the total runoff the concentrations ranged from 100 mu-g/l to 200 mu-g/l decreasing with cumulative rainfall. In the second study, experiments with simulated runoff were carried out to investigate the efficiency of a grassed filter strip. Out of a point source water spiked with different concentrations of isoproturon, dichlorprop-p and terbuthylazine flowed with intensifies of 400 l/h, 1500 l/h and 2000 l/h. In addition, the grassed filter strip was irrigated with sprinklers with an intensity of about 14 mm/h, which corresponds to its infiltration capacity. The simulated runoff leaving the filter strip was collected and analysed for the herbicides. It was shown that the efficiency of the boundary strip in herbicide retention was mainly due to the infiltration of the runoff in the strip.

Journal of the American Water Resources Association (JAWRA) 46(2):311-322. DOI: 10.1111/j.1752-1688.2010.00422.x Riparian forest buffers established according to accepted conservation practice standards have been recommended as one of the most effective tools for mitigating nonpoint source pollution. The midwestern United States is characterized by many kilometers of narrow, naturally occurring forests along streams. However, little is known about the relative effectiveness of these remnant forests compared with these newly established buffers. This study compared the ability of naturally occurring remnant forests with and without adjacent planted grass filters to buffer concentrated flow paths (CFPs) originating in crop fields along first- and second-order streams in three northeast Missouri watersheds. Remnant forests breached by runoff through CFPs were narrower than those that dispersed 100% of the CFPs. Remnant forests with adjacent grass buffers were nearly twice the width as those without grass filters. We also found that CFPs, which developed within remnant forests and at the base of in-field grass waterways, were potential sources of sediments to streams. Methods to mitigate these CFPs warrant further investigation. Our study suggests that although these natural remnant forests provide substantial buffering capacity, both improved management and/or the addition of an adjacent grass filter would improve water quality by reducing sediment loss to streams. Inferences can be used to inform the design and management of similar conservation buffer systems within the region.

AB  - In regions of the United States that are predominately devoted to agricultural production, most grassland habitat remains as linear strips, including areas along roads and within conservation buffer strips. While land management agencies in the United States promote conservation buffer strips as beneficial to wildlife populations, we know little about snake use of these habitats, especially in relation to multiscale factors. Our poor understanding of these relationships hinders effective design and management of these habitats to conserve biodiversity. We evaluated the influence of buffer design, management, and surrounding landscape characteristics on snake occurrence in grassed waterways in southeastern Iowa. We documented snakes at nearly 80% of the grassed waterways and captured 119 individual snakes of five species; one of which, the Smooth Green Snake (Lioclonorophis vernalis), is listed as a species of conservation concern in Iowa. We used a multiple logistic regression and an information theoretic approach to determine the most parsimonious local and landscape variable models that best explained snake species occurrence. The "local" waterway design variable, width, occurred in the best local variable models for three of the five species and was positively associated with snake presence for all three species. Landscape variable models also helped explain snake presence; individual species responded differently to the various landscape metrics. Insights gained from this study may provide opportunities for improving the conservation value of buffer strips to snakes in these fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Wildflower strips have been introduced to increase biodiversity in intensively used arable land in central Europe. Some wild-flower strips are mown or harrowed to maintain species diversity. Management and associated changes in vegetation structure may affect seed predation which is a key factor in plant population dynamics. The aims of the present work were to (1) assess the magnitude and spatial variation of seed predation in managed wildflower strips, (2) identify the responsible seed predators, and (3) investigate differences between seed species. The study was conducted in five wildflower strips in northern Switzerland; the treatments were fallow, mowing and harrowing in winter. Permanent plots were established to investigate the vegetation structure, seed removal from selectively accessible dishes, and rodent abundance in life traps. Seeds of three arable weeds were offered which an used in wildflower seed mixtures (Agrostemma githago, Camelina sativa, Centaurea cyanus). Seeds of Prunus avium were chosen to investigate exclusively predation by rodents. Losses of seed were recorded for one week in four experiments from June to August. Management had only a moderate effect on the structure of the vegetation in summer. Fallow and mown plots were similar and had a tall and dense canopy, whereas plant cover was sparse in the harrowed plots. A total of 101 plant species occurred, although most plots were dominated by Tanacetum vulgare and Elymus repens. In the harrowed plots annual species were more abundant (e.g., C. cyanus Chamomilla recutita, Papaver rhoeas). The selectively accessible dishes revealed that rodents and slugs were the main seed predators. Predation by insects and passerine birds was negligible. Rodents strongly preferred C. cyanus, whereas slugs destroyed most seed of C. sativa. After one week seed losses amounted to 43-51% in C. sativa, 23-25% C. cyanus and 10-12% A. githago. The rank order of the species was similar for the three management treatments and both study periods. Predation of C. sativa was significantly reduced in the harrowed plots, whereas the losses of C. cyanus were independent of management. Live-trapping suggested that Apodemus flavicollis and A. sylvaticus were mainly responsible for seed predation of C, cyanus; Microtus arvalis avoided harrowed plots. It is concluded that only harrowing significantly affects the vegetation structure of wildflower strips and reduces seed losses, that seed predation by rodents and slugs is high, and that arable weeds are affected to a different extent.

AB  - This study evaluates processes that affect nitrate concentrations in groundwater beneath riparian zones in an agricultural watershed. Nitrate pathways in the upper 2 m of groundwater were investigated beneath wooded and grass-shrub riparian zones next to cultivated fields, Because trees can be important components of the overall nitrate pathway in wooded riparian zones, water sources used by riparian trees and possible effects of trees on nitrate concentrations in groundwater were also investigated. Average nitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater beneath the cultivated fields were 5.5 mg/L upgradient of the wooded riparian zone and 3.5 mg/L upgradient of the grass-shrub zone. Shallow groundwater beneath the fields passed through the riparian zones and discharged into streams that had average nitrate concentrations of 8.5 mg/L (as N). Lateral variations of delta D values in groundwater showed that mixing among different water sources occurred beneath the riparian zones. In the wooded riparian zone, nitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater were diluted by upwelling, nitrate-poor, deep groundwater. Upwelling deep groundwater contained ammonium with a delta(15)N of 5 parts per thousand that upon nitrification and mixing with nitrate in shallow groundwater caused nitrate delta(15)N values in shallow groundwater to decrease by as much as 19.5 parts per thousand, Stream water penetrated laterally beneath the wooded riparian zone as far as 19 m from the stream's edge and beneath the grass-shrub zone as far as 27 m from the stream's edge. Nitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater immediately upgradient of where it mixed with stream water averaged 0.4 mg/L in the wooded riparian zone and 0.8 mg/L near the grass-shrub riparian zone. Nitrate concentrations increased toward the streams because of mixing with nitrate-rich stream water. Because nitrate concentrations were larger in stream water than shallow groundwater, concentrated nitrate in the streams cannot have come from shallow groundwater at these sites. Water sources of riparian trees were identified by comparing delta D values of sap water, soil water, groundwater, and stream water. Soil water was the main water source for trees in the outer 4 to 6 m of one part of the wooded riparian zone and outer 10 m of another part. Groundwater was a significant water source fur trees closer to the streams where the water table was less than about 2.1 to 2.7 m below the surface. No evidence was found in the nitrate concentration profiles that trees close to the streams that took up groundwater through their roots also took up nitrate from groundwater. The lack of such evidence is attributed to the nitrate concentration profiles being insufficiently sensitive indicators of nitrate removal by trees.

AB  - Sown wildflower strips have been used to mitigate against the loss of farmland biodiversity e.g. as a part of agri-environmental schemes. In this four-year field experiment, conducted on six field parcels, the ability of wildflower strips to simultaneously promote the availability of pollination services (using bumblebee abundance as a proxy), species diversity (total species richness of bumblebees, butterflies and diurnal moths) and conservation (abundance of habitat specialist butterflies) was evaluated. The results showed that the first two indicators increased strongly and rapidly in wildflower strips until the third year of the experiment. The conservation indicator increased more slowly and this response was related to the forest cover of the surrounding landscape. Furthermore, the benefits of wildflower strips were largely independent of experimentally varied strip properties. It is concluded that wildflower strips are a flexible mitigation tool to promote different biodiversity targets in agricultural systems. Pollination services and species diversity can be promoted in different kinds of landscapes by ensuring local habitat quality. In the promotion of habitat specialists, landscape matrix quality is more critical. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mainly carbon dioxide (CO2), can be mitigated by the planting of trees and shrubs. Appropriate agroforestry practices in Saskatchewan include field and farmyard shelterbelts, wildlife plantations, poplar plantations and managed woodlots. A study was conducted to determine the amount of carbon held in prairie shelterbelts. The effect of the soil type and tree species on biomass and carbon content was measured in shelterbelts in the brown, dark brown and black soil zones of Saskatchewan. For some of the main shelterbelt species, the mean aboveground carbon content was 79 kg/tree (32 t/km) for green ash, 263 kg/tree (105 t/km) for poplar, 144 kg/tree (41 t/km) for white spruce and 26 t/km for caragana. In the brown and the dark brown soils, which are more arid than the black soil zone, trees had 60.6% and 65.5%, respectively, of the biomass and carbon content of trees and shrubs in the black soil zone. Improved, fast-growing poplar clones had the greatest biomass at maturity and fixed the greatest amount of carbon. Simple equations were developed to calculate the carbon contents of prairie shelterbelts, based on easily measured tree or shrub parameters. This paper will discuss the results of this particular study and the broader implications of this work.

AB  - The population ecology of small mammals in hedgerows in arable farmland in Eastern England is described. Features of hedgerows of importance to individual species are examined. Some 97% of the total 3042 mammals captured were wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus, yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis, bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus and common shrew Sorex araneus. Small numbers of harvest mice Micromys minutus, field voles Microtus agrestis, pygmy shrews Sorex minutus and water shrews Neomys fodiens were also caught. Wood mouse, the most numerous species, showed a typical pattern of large numbers in autumn and winter, followed by a simultaneous decline over all hedges in early spring. Population changes were less clear in yellow-necked mouse and bank vole but the yellow-neck mouse was more scarce in the second year of study. Common shrews were most numerous in summer and declined rapidly in autumn. Hedgerow coppicing had a marked effect on yellow-necked mouse number but not on wood mouse. In a extensive survey of mammal numbers in relation to hedgerow features, ground cover was found to be the single largest factor influencing size of bank vole populations. Hedgerow condition (lack of gaps) was important to yellow-necked mice, which thrived only in well-established hedgerows. Wood mice appeared little influenced by the characteristics of the hedge. Common shrews were more abundant in hedgerows with adjacent permanent water.

AB  - Hedgerows studied in Wensleydale (Northern England) play an important role in the landscape in filtering acid pollutants including N compounds. Simultaneously, they serve as a captivity storage for N in this type of (agricultural) landscape. The biodiversity of the hedge herb layer shows a clear dependence on the distance from the N source. Hedge orientation and the nature of the adjacent patches (field or a pasture - etc.) had a much lesser effect. Three types of herb stands were distinguished the first without any distinct dominant (with the highest index of diversity), the second with a "shade-tolerant" dominant and the third with a "light-tolerant" dominant (with the lowest index of diversity).

AB  - Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) is a very difficult crop to cultivate organically. Only few organic methods are effective in reducing damage from insects and diseases. The current investigation assessed the use of the beneficial ascomycete Trichoderma asperellum (Samuels, Lieckf & Nirenberg) and a trap crop of Brassica rapa L. turnip rape cv. "Brachina," both with and without an application of slurry fertilizer, for pest suppression and yield enhancement of winter oilseed rape cv. "Californium." The presence of the trap crop significantly increased 1000 grain weight but not total yield or lipid content of the oilseed rape because turnip rape was not attractive enough to prevent colonization of the principal crop. Increase in 1000 grain weight, lipid content, and total seed yield were found in oilseed rape sprayed with three applications of T. asperellum, but the ascomycete had no influence on the insect pests observed. The effects of the fertilizer are about equal to the effects of the fungus on 1000 grain weight and on lipid content.

AB  - Abstract: Habitat loss and fragmentation in agricultural landscapes lead to severe declines of abundance and richness of many insect species in the remaining isolated semi-natural habitats. We analysed possible barrier effects of large hedges and corridor effects of narrow grass strips that were hypothesized to affect foraging and dispersal of hymenopterans. We selected calcareous grasslands in the vicinity of Göttingen (Germany), which harbour high Hymenoptera diversity and are starting points for foraging and dispersal in the landscape. We installed pan traps to sample bees (i) on the grasslands; (ii) on grassland edges behind adjacent hedges (potential barriers) and without hedges; (iii) on grass strips in 100m distance to the grassland, which were connected or unconnected to the grassland; and (iv) unconnected (isolated) grass strips in 300m and 750m distance to test for corridor and isolation effects on abundance and species richness of foraging wild bees. Additionally we provided trap nests for bees, wasps and their parasitoids on the grasslands and the strips. Species abundance and richness declined with increasing isolation from grasslands for foraging solitary bees, trap-nesting bees, wasps and parasitoids, but not for foraging bumblebees. Hedges did not confine movement of foraging bees. We found no mitigating effects of (100m) corridor strips on any of the observed groups. We conclude that conservation of semi-natural habitats as sources of bee and wasp diversity is important and that grass strips act as sinks rather than corridors when high quality patches are nearby.

AB  - Rill erosion, surface runoff and storage of sediment and phosphorus in buffer zones were investigated during three winters on ca. 140 arable field slope units in twenty places in Denmark covering all landscape types, climate gradients and dominant soil types. The dominant soils are Alfisols and Spoclosols, with textural composition typically ranging from sand to loam. The average slope is 7% (range: 2-20%) and median buffer zone width was 8.3m (range: 0.6-125 m). The geometric mean annual rill erosion was 0.33 m(3) ha(-1) equalling to 495 kg sediment ha(-1) and 0.25 kg Pha(-1). The deposition of sediment on the field, in the buffer zone and delivery of soil to the stream was surveyed within the 140 slope units following three winters. Deposition of sediment in the buffer zone was observed in 31% (1997/98), 31% (1998/99) and 29% (1999/2000) of the slope units. Delivery of soil across the edge of the stream was observed in 23% (1997/98), 17% (1998/99) and 25% (1999/2000) of the 140 slope units. Median dissolved Cr concentration in surface runoff was 0.18 mg Pl(-1) (range: 0.029-16.294 mg Pl(-1)). A probability model was developed to predict the efficiency of different widths of buffer zones.

AB  - Soil erosion (rill erosion) was measured in 88 Danish slope units during three winter periods (1993/94-1996/97) and 140 slope units during the winter periods of 1997/98 and 1998/99. The mean annual amount of soil mobilized by rill erosion per hectare slope unit exhibited large temporal variation, being highest in the wet and cold winter of 1993/94 (0.89 m(3) ha(-1)) and lowest in the warmer and drier winter of 1997/98 (0.10 m(3) ha(-1)). Average annual soil erosion amounted to 0.31 m(3) ha(-1), corresponding to 465 kg ha(-1). Estimated phosphorus (P) loss was 0.29 kg P ha(-1). The average annual volume of soil eroded differed significantly between four main types of land management practice, being highest for slope units cropped with winter cereals (0.36 m(3) ha(-1)) and lowest for slope units with grass (0.00 m(3) ha(-1)). A mass balance fur two selected rill systems revealed that no sediment and particulate P (PP) escaped across a 29 m wide buffer zone, whereas 38% of soil and 68% of PP passed through a 0.5 m wide buffer zone.

AB  - Previous studies have indicated that dissolved-phase metolachlor [2-chloro-N-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N-(methoxy-1-methylethyl) acetamide] transported in surface runoff is retained by vegetative filter strips to a greater degree than either metolachlor oxanilic acid 12-[(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl) (2-methoxy-1-methylethyl)amino]-2-oxo-acetic acid] (OA) or metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid [2-[(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl) (2-methoxy-1-methylethyl-1)amino]-2-oxoethanesul-fonic acid] (ESA), two primary metabolites of metolachlor. Adsorption-desorption of ESA and OA in vegetated filter strip soil (VFSS) has not been evaluated, yet these data are required to assess the mobility of these compounds in VFSS. The objective of this experiment was to compare metolachlor, ESA, and OA adsorption and desorption parameters between VFSS and cultivated soil (CS). Adsorption and desorption isotherms were determined using the batch equilibrium procedure. With the exception of a 1.7-fold increase in organic carbon content in the VFSS, the evaluated chemical and physical properties of the soils were similar. Sorption coefficients for metolachlor were 88% higher in VFSS than in CS. In contrast, sorption coefficients for ESA and OA were not different between soils. Relative to metolachlor, sorption coefficients for ESA and OA were at least 79% lower in both soils. Metolachlor desorption coefficients were 59% higher in the VFSS than in the CS. Desorption coefficients for ESA and OA were not different between soils. Relative to metolachlor, desorption coefficients for ESA and OA were at least 66% lower in both soils. These data indicate that the mobility of ESA and OA will be greater than metolachlor in both soils. However, higher organic carbon content in VFSS relative to CS may limit the subsequent transport of metolachlor from the vegetated filter strip.

AB  - Adsorption and desorption of atrazine and its metabolites in vegetated filter strip soil (VFS) has not been evaluated, yet these data are needed to predict the transport of these compounds through the VFS. Adsorption and desorption parameters for atrazine, desethylatrazine (DEA), deisopropylatrazine (DIA), and hydroxyatrazine (HA) were compared between a cultivated Houston Black clay (CS) and an adjacent 12-year-old VFS established in a mixed stand of bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] and buffalograss [Buchloe dactyloides (Nutt. Engelm)]. Adsorption and desorption isotherms were determined by batch equilibrium. The evaluated chemical and physical properties of the VFS and CS were similar with the exception of a 1.7-fold increase in the organic carbon content of the VFS. Adsorption and desorption coefficients for atrazine were at least 59% higher in VFS than in CS. The adsorption coefficient for HA was 48% higher in VFS compared with CS, but desorption was not statistically different between soils. Adsorption and desorption coefficients for IDEA and DIA were not statistically different between soils. The predicted order of mobility in CS is HA < atrazine = DIA = IDEA. In VFS, the predicted order of mobility is HA < atrazine = DIA < IDEA. These data indicate that the higher organic carbon in VFS will likely retard the transport of atrazine and HA to surface and ground waters; however, the transport rates of IDEA and DIA will be similar between soils.

AB  - Agri-environment schemes have been established in many European countries to counteract the ongoing decline of farmland birds. In this study, the selection of foraging habitat by breeding skylarks was examined in relation to agri-environmental management on Dutch farmland. Field margin use was quantified and, based on the observed flight distances, the appropriateness of the current spatial arrangement of field margins in the study landscape was evaluated. Skylarks preferred field margins for foraging over all other habitat types relative to their surface area within the territories. The visiting rate of field margins decreased with increasing distance to the nest, and especially dropped markedly when the distance between the nest and a field margin exceeded 100 m. Analysis of the current spatial arrangement of field margins in the landscape suggested that the area of skylark breeding habitat within 100 m of a field margin could be increased by 46%. This was due to the placement of field margins alongside unsuitable breeding habitat and to the positioning of field margins at short distances from each other. The efficiency of agri-environmental management for skylarks can likely be improved by a more careful spatial arrangement of field margins in the landscape. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of the study was to recognize features characterizing development of macrofungi communities occurring in afforestations planted in crop fields and to evaluate the role of these habitats in conservation of macrofungi and preserve high species richness. The study was carried out in 1998-2006 and covered four shelterbelts (planted in 1993-1996) located in the area of the Dezydery Chłapowski Landscape Park (western part of Poland). The shelterbelts were colonized by macrofungi just after planting. During first years of their growth a total of 174 species were recorded. Species composition changed significantly between initial (1998-2000) and final (2004-2006) period of study. Similarity of macrofungi communities (expressed as the Sörensen's index) between these two periods in studied shelterbelts ranged between 37 and 46%. In spite of high similarity in tree species composition between studied afforestations (69-80%), the communities of macrofungi differed strongly between these sampling plots (Sörensen's index was equal to about 40%). Pattern of changes in percentage share of functional groups, i.e. parasitic, mycorrhizal and saprotrophs (humicolous, lignicolous, litter-inhibiting and muscicolous ones) in individual afforestations was different but the diversity of the communities measured with the Shannon-Weaver H' index on the basis of share of functional groups tended to increase with ageing of afforestations. On average, the share of fungi growing on soil (ectomycorrhizal and humicolous saprotrophic species) was highest among all distinguished groups. Species composition of particular functional group was changing during the study period. A species representing new groups (lignicolous saprotrophs and parasites) were appearing in some shelterbelts in successive years. There were recorded some species rare in Poland, eg. Psilocybe (Stropharia) melanosperma (Bull. ex Pers.: Fr.) Noordel., Clavariadelphus fistulosus (Holmsk.: Fr.) Corner, Thelephora caryophyllea (Schaeff.): Fr., Agrocybe arvalis (Fr.) Singer, Galerina clavata (Velen.) Kühner, Lachnella alboviolascens (Alb. & Schwein.: Fr.) Fr., Macrocystidia cucumis f. minor Joss, Mycena amicta (Fr.) Quél., Psilocybe (Stropharia) inuncta (Fr.: Fr.) Noordel., Trichophaea gregaria (Rehm) Boud. and Typhula filata (Pers.) Herter. Occurrence of rare and threatened species in young shelterbelts indicates that such afforestations, planted in crop fields but not treated by agricultural practices, contribute to the protection of species richness of macrofungi associated with tree communities and they are important substitute habitats for many species.

AB  - Protection of high biodiversity in an intensively farmed areas is strongly related to managing the diverse structure of a landscape, for example by planting shelterbelts. The study was aimed at recognition of avifauna dynamics in young (with the age of 1-4 years at the beginning of the study) shelterbelts (N=9) and at estimation of their importance for farmland birds. Bird density was estimated by mapping method in successive years 1996-2001 and the data were combined and analysed in respect to age of shelterbelts. Eighteen breeding species were found (5-8 pairs km-1), among them most abundant were Corn Bunting (Miliaria calandra) (with dominance of 33%), Yellow Wagtail (Motacilla flava) (19%) and Whitethroat (Sylvia communis) (12%). No trend in the changes of species richness and total density was recorded. The density of species preferring building nests and/or feeding in herb layer (like Yellow Wagtail, Skylark Alauda arvensis and Whinchat Saxicola rubetra) decreased during study period while the density of species associated to higher layers of vegetation like Yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella), Red-backed Shrike (Lanius collurio) increased. According to earlier study, bird species richness and abundance in studied young shelterbelts were lower than in several dozens years old ones. However, in relation to species colonization both classes of shelterbelts (species building their nests on the ground or in low shrubs), young shelterbelts were as important as old ones.
